TST MEASURES AN IN VIVO CELLULAR REACTION MEDIATED BY TH1 CELLS AT THE SITE OF TUBERCULIN INJECTION. ALTHOUGH TST DETECTS PREVIOUS EXPOSURE TO MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS (MTB), IT PRESENTS LOW SPECIFICITY AND IS NOT CAPABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE LATENT INFECTION FROM ACTIVE TB DISEASE. FEW YEARS AGO, THE IDENTIFICATION OF HIGHLY SPECIFIC RD1 REGION IN MTB GENOME DROVE THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW IN VITRO TB SPECIFIC TESTS. THE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE QUANTIFERON(R) TB GOLD IN TUBE6 IS AN EXAMPLE OF SUCH IN VITRO TESTS (ALSO KNOWN AS IGRA). IGRA DETECTS IFN- RELEASED FROM LYMPHOCYTES AFTER IN VITRO INCUBATION WITH MTB ANTIGENS. AS OPPOSED TO TST, IGRA OFFER ENHANCED SPECIFICITY AND ARE NOT INFLUENCED BY CROSS-REACTIVITY TO BCG AND OTHER NON-TUBERCULOUS MYCOBACTERIA (NTM). HOWEVER, IT IS STILL CONTROVERSIAL WHETHER IGRA CAN REPLACE TST AS THE DIAGNOSTIC TEST OF CHOICE. ALTHOUGH IGRA IS, BY DEFINITION, MORE SPECIFIC THAN TST, SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE REPORTED AN ELEVATED FREQUENCY OF IGRA REVERSIONS AND CONVERSIONS7-15 AS WELL AS DISCORDANCE BETWEEN IGRA AND TST 4, 16, 17. WE, RECENTLY, REPORTED A HIGH DISCORDANCE RATE (21%) BETWEEN THE TWO TESTS, WITH THE MAJORITY OF DISCORDANCE COMING FROM HHC WITH TST POSITIVE AND IGRA NEGATIVE RESULTS.

BRUCELLA ABORTUS STRAIN 19 VACCINE, DEVELOPED IN THE 1930S, IS THE PRINCIPAL VACCINE USED TO PREVENT TRANSMISSION OF BRUCELLOSIS FROM CATTLE TO HUMANS WORLDWIDE AND IN BRAZIL. THE MECHANISMS THAT MEDIATE PROTECTION BY STRAIN 19 ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD. HOST MECHANISMS OF INNATE IMMUNITY INDUCED BY THE VACCINE THAT CONTROL INFECTION REMAIN OBSCURE. INDEED, THE VACCINE CONTAINS SEVERAL PROPERTIES THAT ARE INHIBITORY TO HOST IMMUNITY. OUR RESEARCH GROUP WAS THE FIRST TO IMPLICATE THE ROLE OF INFLAMMASOME RECEPTORS IN THE CONTROL OF BRUCELLA ABORTUS INFECTION. FURTHER, OUR TEAM HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT IFN-ASSR KO MICE ARE MORE RESISTANT TO INFECTION SUGGESTING THAT TYPE I IFN SIGNALING FAVORS BRUCELLA MULTIPLICATION IN THE HOST. THEREFORE, OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO RESOLVE THE CONUNDRUM OF HOW BRUCELLA ACTIVATES INNATE IMMUNE COMPONENTS THAT RESULTS IN HOST RESISTANCE VERSUS BACTERIAL SUBVERSION OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE. BRUCELLA SPP ARE ONE OF THE FEW BACTERIAL PATHOGENS THAT USE THE ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM (ER) AS ITS REPLICATIVE NICHE. THE UNFOLDED PROTEIN RESPONSE (UPR) IS A CONSERVED SIGNALING PATHWAY IN EUKARYOTES THAT MEDIATES CELLULAR ADAPTATION TO PROTEIN-FOLDING STRESS IN THE ER. THE UPR ALSO MODULATES INNATE IMMUNITY. RECENTLY, OUR COLLABORATORS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT BRUCELLA INDUCES THE UPR THAT ENABLES ITS INTRACELLULAR REPLICATION. BASED ON THESE COMPELLING PRELIMINARY DATA, WE PROPOSE TO TEST THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS THAT BRUCELLA ABORTUS STRAIN 19 ACTIVATES PROTECTIVE INNATE IMMUNE MEDIATORS AND TRIGGERS THE UPR TO SECURE INTRACELLULAR REPLICATION. FURTHER, WE PROPOSE THAT THE STRAIN 19 INDUCED UPR REGULATES CYTOKINE PRODUCTION. OUR SPECIFIC AIMS ARE TO DETERMINE WHETHER: 1) NLRP3 INFLAMMASOME ACTIVATION AND IL-1SS SECRETION INDUCED BY BRUCELLA REQUIRES THE UPR; 2) THE BACTERIAL VIRULENCE FACTOR SS TCPB THAT MODULATES HOST CELL MICROTUBULES ACTIVATES THE NLRP3 INFLAMMASOME AND IL-1SS AND 3) THE UPR ACTIVATED BY BRUCELLA ABORTUS STRAIN 19 REGULATES STING EXPRESSION AND TYPE I INTERFERON PRODUCTION TO FACILITATE BACTERIAL PERSISTENCE. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR APPROACH WILL SHED LIGHT ON THE MECHANISMS OF IMMUNITY AGAINST THIS IMPORTANT HUMAN AND ANIMAL PATHOGEN. ADDITIONALLY, CRITICAL INFORMATION GAINED FROM THESE SPECIFIC AIMS WILL BEGIN TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT MECHANISMS OF PROTECTION INDUCED BY B.

BUT CHALLENGES REMAIN IN TERMS OF SCALING UP SUCCESSFUL NATIONAL PROGRAMS. THIS STUDY WILL CONTRIBUTE TO KNOWLEDGE ON THE IMPACT OF LARGE-SCALE INITIATIVES ADDRESSING BOTH THE SOCIAL AND MEDICAL DETERMINANTS OF HIV/AIDS BY COMBINING DATA FROM BRAZIL’S NATIONAL HIV/AIDS REGISTRY WITH OTHER LARGESCALE DATABASES INCLUDING THE “100 MILLION BRAZILIAN COHORT”: A VIRTUAL COHORT OF MORE THAN 100 MILLION INDIVIDUALS OVER 18 YEARS OBTAINED BY THE LINKAGE OF LARGE COUNTRYWIDE SOCIOECONOMIC AND HEALTH DATASETS. IT WILL BE THE FIRST STUDY TO FOLLOW SUCH A LARGE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS OVER TIME AND IN NON-EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS TO UNDERSTAND HOW SOCIAL DETERMINANTS, CONDITIONAL CASH TRANSFERS AND PRIMARY HEALTH CARE AFFECT HIV/AIDS INCIDENCE, HOSPITALIZATION AND MORTALITY; AND HOW RECEIPT OF SOCIAL PROTECTIONS AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL AFFECTS HIV/AIDS OUTCOMES (ART ADHERENCE AND MORTALITY). THANKS TO THE UNPRECEDENTED DIMENSION OF THE DATASET AND THE METHODS PROPOSED, WE WILL ASSESS IMPACT HETEROGENEITIES OF THE TWO INTERVENTIONS IN A LARGE RANGE OF DIFFERENT SUBPOPULATIONS, AS WELL AS POSSIBLE SYNERGISTIC EFFECTS. USING THE LONGITUDINAL ASPECT OF THE COHORT WE WILL EXPLORE AND ASSESS IN DEPTH EXPECTED AND UNEXPECTED DYNAMICS, LAGGED AND LONG- TERM EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN LIVING CONDITIONS AND IN EXPOSURES TO CONDITIONAL CASH TRANSFERS AND COMMUNITY- BASED PRIMARY HEALTH CARE. WE WILL THEN EXPAND THE COHORT AND INTEGRATE ESTIMATES FROM THE RETROSPECTIVE EVALUATIONS WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF FORECASTING FOR SEVERAL ALTERNATIVE POLICY SCENARIOS. USING AN INNOVATIVE JOINED MICROSIMULATION AND AGENT-BASED MODEL WE WILL BE ABLE TO FORECAST THE EFFECTS OF THE CURRENT BRAZILIAN ECONOMIC CRISIS, OVERALL AND FOR SEVERAL SUBPOPULATIONS, ON THE HIV/AIDS EPIDEMIC. WE WILL FORECAST AND COMPARE THE IMPACT OF A WIDE RANGE OF ALTERNATIVE POLICY SCENARIOS, SUCH AS THE MAINTENANCE OF CURRENT LEVELS OF SUPPORT OF CONDITIONAL CASH TRANSFER AND PRIMARY CARE, REDUCTIONS OF COVERAGE AND BENEFITS DUE TO FISCAL AUSTERITY MEASURES, OR EXPANSION IN DIFFERENT SUBPOPULATION AND WITH DIFFERENT DYNAMICS. WE WILL CALIBRATE AND SELECT THE COMBINATIONS OF POLICY RESPONSE ABLE TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS ON THE HIV/AIDS EPIDEMIC, EVEN DURING AN ECONOMIC CRISIS.

USING THE LONGITUDINAL ASPECT OF THE COHORT WE WILL EXPLORE AND ASSESS IN DEPTH EXPECTED AND UNEXPECTED DYNAMICS, LAGGED AND LONG- TERM EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN LIVING CONDITIONS AND IN EXPOSURES TO CONDITIONAL CASH TRANSFERS AND COMMUNITY- BASED PRIMARY HEALTH CARE. WE WILL THEN EXPAND THE COHORT AND INTEGRATE ESTIMATES FROM THE RETROSPECTIVE EVALUATIONS WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF FORECASTING FOR SEVERAL ALTERNATIVE POLICY SCENARIOS. USING AN INNOVATIVE JOINED MICROSIMULATION AND AGENT-BASED MODEL WE WILL BE ABLE TO FORECAST THE EFFECTS OF THE CURRENT BRAZILIAN ECONOMIC CRISIS, OVERALL AND FOR SEVERAL SUBPOPULATIONS, ON THE HIV/AIDS EPIDEMIC. WE WILL FORECAST AND COMPARE THE IMPACT OF A WIDE RANGE OF ALTERNATIVE POLICY SCENARIOS, SUCH AS THE MAINTENANCE OF CURRENT LEVELS OF SUPPORT OF CONDITIONAL CASH TRANSFER AND PRIMARY CARE, REDUCTIONS OF COVERAGE AND BENEFITS DUE TO FISCAL AUSTERITY MEASURES, OR EXPANSION IN DIFFERENT SUBPOPULATION AND WITH DIFFERENT DYNAMICS. WE WILL CALIBRATE AND SELECT THE COMBINATIONS OF POLICY RESPONSE ABLE TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS ON THE HIV/AIDS EPIDEMIC, EVEN DURING AN ECONOMIC CRISIS. THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS AND THE INNOVATIVE MATHEMATICAL MODELS PRODUCED IN THIS PROJECT WILL REPRESENT AN ESSENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE UNDERSTANDING AND CONTROL OF HIV/AIDS IN LOWER AND MIDDLE INCOME COUNTRY SETTINGS, AS WELL AS FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES.|2022-03-17|Department of Health and Human Services|National Institutes of Health|FUNDACAO DE APOIO A PESQUISA E A EXTENSAO|FUNDACAO DE APOIO A PESQUISA E A EXTENSAO|BRAZIL|BRAZIL|||||||

THESE FACTORS INTERFERE WITH DEVELOPMENT, LIMIT OPPORTUNITIES, AND HAMPER ACHIEVEMENT OF A FULFILLING LIFE AS ADULTS. ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES CAN LEAD TO IMPROVED OUTCOMES AT THE POPULATION LEVEL AND BETTER COST-EFFECTIVENESS FOR HEALTH SERVICES. THIS SHOULD BE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES, DUE TO THE SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF FINANCIALLY AND SOCIALLY VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS IN THESE SETTINGS. CASH TRANSFER PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN A PROMISING WAY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE SOCIAL DRIVERS FOR POOR MENTAL HEALTH AMONG YOUTH. IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT SUCH PROGRAMS CAN ALLEVIATE INCOME RESTRICTION, INCREASE SCHOOLING AND ACCESS TO HEALTH FACILITIES, AND DECREASE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND VIOLENCE IN FAMILIES. HOWEVER, IT IS STILL UNCLEAR WHICH PATHWAYS AND MECHANISMS EXPLAIN THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SOCIOECONOMIC SUPPORT AND LOWER MENTAL ILLNESS AMONG YOUTH. IN THIS PROJECT, WE WILL EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF SOCIAL DRIVERS ON YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH-RELATED HOSPITALIZATIONS AND SUICIDE, TEST MECHANISMS AND PATHWAYS OF A COUNTRYWIDE SOCIOECONOMIC INTERVENTION, AND EXAMINE THE TIMING OF THE INTERVENTION DURING THE LIFE COURSE. FOR EXAMPLE, DETERMINING WHETHER CASH TRANSFERS DELIVERED EARLIER IN LIFE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO BETTER OUTCOMES OVER TIME. THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO INVESTIGATE THE CASH TRANSFER EFFECT ON VULNERABLE GROUPS (AFRICAN DESCENDANTS, WOMEN, AND YOUTH WITH LOWER INCOME). WE WILL EVALUATE SOCIAL DRIVERS’ DETERMINATION AND THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BEING BENEFICIARIES OF THE CONDITIONAL CASH TRANSFER PROGRAM, CALLED THE BOLSA FAMILIA PROGRAM (BFP), AND MENTAL ILLNESS AND ITS LONG-TERM EFFECTS USING ROBUST METHODOLOGIES FOR BIG DATASETS, SUCH AS REGRESSION DISCONTINUITY DESIGNS, PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING AND DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCES. WE WILL TEST MECHANISMS AND PATHWAYS, BETWEEN BFP AND MENTAL HEALTH-RELATED HOSPITALIZATIONS AND SUICIDE AMONG YOUTH USING STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING. FURTHERMORE, WE WILL PERFORM MICROSIMULATIONS TO GENERATE PROJECTIONS REGARDING HOW MENTAL HEALTH-RELATED HOSPITALIZATIONS AND SUICIDE TRENDS WILL BE IN THE FUTURE BASED ON THE CURRENT STATE, AND HOW BFP IMPLEMENTATION SCENARIOS WILL AFFECT THESE TRENDS. THE RESULTS OF THIS PROJECT WILL BE OF VITAL IMPORTANCE TO GUIDE POLICIES AND PROGRAMS TO IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH AND REDUCE MENTAL HEALTH-RELATED HOSPITALIZATIONS AND SUICIDE IN YOUTH. IT WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION TO IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE PROGRAMS WORLDWIDE. FINALLY, IT CAN POTENTIALLY ADVANCE THE GLOBAL DEBATE ON THE ECONOMIC RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC AND TIMES OF ECONOMIC CRISES.

THERE IS NO EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR CHRONIC CHAGAS DISEASE AND RESISTANT STRAINS TO THE CURRENT FRONTLINE TREATMENT HAVE ALREADY EMERGED. THERE IS A GROWING NEED FOR NEW PHARMACOLOGICAL ALTERNATIVES TO TREAT THIS DISEASE.  THIS PROPOSAL EXPLOITS A TARGET-BASED APPROACH TO SEARCH FOR LEAD COMPOUNDS AGAINST CHAGAS DISEASE. TRYPANOSOMA CRUZI DIHYDROOROTATE DEHYDROGENASE (TCDHODH) IS A FLAVIN MONONUCLEOTIDE CONTAINING ENZYME, WHICH CATALYZES THE OXIDATION OF L-DIHYDROOROTATE TO OROTATE, THE FOURTH STEP AND ONLY REDOX REACTION IN THE DE NOVO BIOSYNTHESIS OF PYRIMIDINE NUCLEOTIDES. TCDHODH WAS ALSO DESCRIBED AS A SOLUBLE FUMARATE REDUCTASE PLAYING A ROLE IN CONNECTING SUCCINATE/FUMARATE METABOLISM TO DE NOVO PYRIMIDINE BIOSYNTHESIS. DHODH HAS ALREADY BEEN EXTENSIVELY EXPLOITED AS A DRUG TARGET FOR PROLIFERATIVE AND PARASITIC DISEASES. GENETIC STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT DHODH IS ESSENTIAL FOR T. CRUZI SURVIVAL PROVIDING EVIDENCE THAT THIS ENZYME IS AN ATTRACTIVE TARGET FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANTICHAGASIC DRUGS.  THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO CHEMICALLY VALIDATE TCDHODH AS A NEW DRUG TARGET FOR CHAGAS DISEASE AND TO PROVIDE LEADS FOR DRUG DEVELOPMENT. OUR APPROACH COMBINES MULTIPLE TECHNIQUES INCLUDING COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY, ENZYMOLOGY, STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY, PARASITOLOGY, AND MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY TO DEVELOP SELECTIVE AND COVALENT INHIBITORS OF TCDHODH. INITIALLY, WE WILL SEEK TO GAIN A GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF THE DHODH HOT SPOTS BY USING SOLVENT MAPPING TO CHARACTERIZE THE BINDING POCKETS WITH THE FLEXIBLE ACTIVE-SITE LOOP OPEN AND CLOSED. THIS INFORMATION WILL HELP STRENGTHEN THE COMPUTATIONAL MODELING, AND SUBSEQUENT COMPOUND DESIGN.  COVALENT INHIBITION OF ENZYMES BASED ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF A SET OF CYSTEINE TARGETING COVALENT WARHEADS INCLUDING ACRYLAMIDES, VINYL SULFONES AND NITRILES, HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE A SUCCESSFUL APPROACH IN DRUG DISCOVERY PIPELINES. IN OUR PROPOSAL, AN INITIAL SET OF PUTATIVE INHIBITORS THAT INCORPORATE AN ACRYLAMIDE WARHEAD HAVE ALREADY BEEN RATIONALLY DESIGNED TO TARGET THE TCDHODH ACTIVE-SITE CYSTEINE. PREDICTED INHIBITORS WILL BE EVALUATED FOR INHIBITORY POTENCY AND MECHANISM OF INHIBITION AGAINST TCDHODH, CYTOTOXICITY AND ITS ANTI-PARASITIC EFFECTS IN CELL CULTURE. X-RAY CRYSTALLOGRAPHY, FRAGMENT SCREENING AND MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY WILL BE COMBINED TO PROVIDE THE CHEMICAL BASIS FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF A NEW GENERATION OF POTENT, SELECTIVE, AND DRUG-LIKE INHIBITORS. THE TOP 3 INHIBITORS THAT MEET LEAD CRITERIA (INCLUDING PK AND TOLERABILITY) WILL HAVE THEIR EFFICACY EVALUATED BY DNDI VIA AN IN-KIND CONTRIBUTION TO THE PROJECT.

THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO SUPPORT A BROADER CONVERSATION ON THE ETHICAL PRINCIPLES ASSOCIATED WITH TD RESEARCH. TRAINING EXCHANGES AND THE STEP FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM WILL PREPARE THE NEXT GENERATION OF SCIENCE-POLICY LEADERS, INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE WELL EQUIPPED TO EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION INTO DECISION MAKING PROCESSES FOR THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR. THESE FELLOWS WILL ALSO BE CONNECTED TO OTHER REGIONAL AND GLOBAL FELLOW NETWORKS, INCREASING THEIR COLLABORATION OPPORTUNITIES. TD TRAININGS WILL AIM AT INCREASING THE INCLUSION OF PEOPLE AND COUNTRIES THAT HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED IN THE SCIENCES, THEREBY FOMENTING A MORE EQUITABLE AND DIVERSE SCIENCE-POLICY COMMUNITY. THIS AWARD REFLECTS NSF'S STATUTORY MISSION AND HAS BEEN DEEMED WORTHY OF SUPPORT THROUGH EVALUATION USING THE FOUNDATION'S INTELLECTUAL MERIT AND BROADER IMPACTS REVIEW CRITERIA.|2022-08-31|National Science Foundation|National Science Foundation|INSTITUTO INTERAMERICANO PARA LA INVESTIGACION DEL CAMBIO GLOBAL||BRAZIL|URUGUAY|||||||

THEREFORE, IT IS INTENDED IN THIS PROJECT TO APPLY ALL THIS KNOWLEDGE AND ARTICULATION TO IDENTIFY METHODOLOGIES AND TOOLS THAT ALLOW OVERCOMING EXISTING BARRIERS. THE RESULTS OBTAINED WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF DIAGNOSED PATIENTS TO WHOM TREATMENT WILL BE OFFERED AND IDENTIFY STRATEGIES AND BIOMARKERS THAT MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO IMPROVE PATIENT FOLLOW-UP AND HELP EVALUATE NEW TREATMENT CANDIDATES."|2022-03-15|Department of Health and Human Services|National Institutes of Health|FUNDACAO FACULDADE DE MEDICINA|FUNDACAO FACULDADE DE MEDICINA|BRAZIL|BRAZIL|||||||

IT IS ESTIMATED THAT 6MILLION PEOPLE ARE INFECTED BY T. CRUZI WORLDWIDE, WITH 70MILLION AT RISK OF INFECTION. THE MAJORITY OF T. CRUZI-CHRONICALLY INFECTED INDIVIDUALS REMAIN IN AN ASYMPTOMATIC CLINICAL FORM, NAMED INDETERMINATE, WHILE ABOUT 30% OF THE PATIENTS DEVELOP A SEVERE CARDIOMYOPATHY THAT LEADS TO OVER 10,000 DEATHS/YEAR. THERE IS NO VACCINE TO PREVENT CHD, NOR INTERVENTIONS THAT CAN PREVENT THE PROGRESSION OF CARDIOMYOPATHY. CHD CARDIOMYOPATHY IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF AN INFLAMMATORY REACTION, WHICH LEADS TO TISSUE DESTRUCTION AND PATHOLOGY. DESPITE THE COMPLEXITY OF THE HOST-PARASITE INTERACTION THAT LEADS TO CARDIOMIOPATHY, IT IS A CONSENSUS THAT HOST'S IMMUNE RESPONSE IS CRITICAL IN DETERMINING DISEASE OUTCOME. WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY SHOWN THAT THE INDETERMINATE AND CARDIAC CLINICAL FORMS OF CHD ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A PREDOMINANT EXPRESSION OF DOWN MODULATORY AND INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES, RESPECTIVELY. WE HAVE ALSO SHOWN THAT CD4-CD8- (DOUBLE- NEGATIVE – DN) T CELLS ARE MAJOR SOURCES OF THESE CYTOKINES IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC CHD (CCHD). IN ADDITION, WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT IN VITRO BLOCKING OF T. CRUZI-INDUCED DN T CELL ACTIVATION, THROUGH THE INHIBITION OF ANTIGEN PRESENTATION VIA CD1D, SHIFTS THE CYTOKINE EXPRESSION OF DN T CELLS FROM AN INFLAMMATORY TO A PREDOMINANTLY ANTI-INFLAMMATORY PROFILE.

ADDITIONALLY, IN 19S6 WE REPORTED A NEW CLINICAL FORM OF LEISHMANIASIS CALLED DISSEMINATED LEISHMANIASIS (DL). DL IS DEFINED BY THE SUDDEN DEVELOPMENT OF A FEBRILE ILLNESS IN AN INDIVIDUAL WITH A PRIMARY ULCER AND THE APPEARANCE OF 10 AND UP TO 1000 ACNEIFORM PAPULES AND ULCERATED LESIONS SPANNING THE WHOLE BODY. DL IS OF GROWING CONCERN BECAUSE OF THE INCREASING NUMBER OF CASES IN THE LAST 20 YEARS, FROM 0.2% TO 4% IN NORTHEASTERN BRAZIL, THE PRESENCE OF A LARGE NUMBER OF LESIONS, THE OCCURRENCE OF MUCOSAL DISEASE IN UP TO 40% OF THE PATIENTS, AND A HIGH RATE OF FAILURE TO THERAPY. L. BRAZILIENSIS IS POLYMORPHIC AND ISOLATES THAT CAUSE DL HAVE GENOTYPIC CHARACTERISTICS DIFFERENT FROM CL AND ML. ADDITIONALLY PARASITES ISOLATED FROM DL INDUCE HIGHER PRODUCTION OF PRO- INFLAMMATORY CHEMOKINES AND TNF IN MACROPHAGES THAN CL ISOLATES. THE HISTOPATHOLOGIC FINDINGS IN DL ARE SIMILAR TO CL WITH FEW PARASITES, LYMPHOCYTE INFILTRATION AND GRANULOMA FORMATION. MOREOVER WE HAVE NOT DETECTED ANY IMPAIRMENT OF MACROPHAGES IN LEISHMANIA KILLING AND NO IMPAIRMENT IN T CELLS RESPONSE IN DL. IN CONTRAST MACROPHAGES FROM DL PRODUCE HIGHER LEVELS OF TNF, CXCL9 AND CXCL 1O THAN CL CELLS. WE HAVE ALSO DEMONSTRATED THAT CDS CYTOLYTIC T CELLS MEDIATE INCREASED PATHOLOGY IN CL PATIENTS AND METASTASIS IN L. BRAZI/IENSIS INFECTION. IT IS KNOWN THAT INFLAMMATION PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN METASTASIS IN CANCER. OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT AN EXAGGERATED INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE MEDIATED BY MACROPHAGES AND CDS T CELLS LEADS TO METASTASIS AND PATHOLOGY IN DL.

THESE AIMS WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH: 1. DEVELOPMENT OF A RESEARCH AGENDA FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING AN INTERVENTION FOR THE IDENTIFICATION AND TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION AMONG PEOPLE ATTENDING PROGRAMS FOR CHRONIC DISEASES. THIS INTERVENTION WILL INVOLVE TWO KEY ELEMENTS: A) IMPROVED RECOGNITION AND B) IMPROVED PSYCHO-SOCIAL MANAGEMENT OF DEPRESSION IN DIVERSE HEALTH CARE SETTINGS IN LA & C. IT WILL BE MOSTLY DELIVERED THROUGH THE USE OF MOBILE PHONES, WITH MINIMAL ASSISTANCE FROM PRIMARY CARE AUXILIARY NURSES, WITH SUBSTANTIAL TASK-SHIFTING. THE MAIN EMPHASIS IS ON PATIENTS HELPING THEMSELVES THROUGH USING RESOURCES THAT ARE CURRENTLY DELIVERED ON A ONE-TO-ONE BASIS BY SPECIALIZED HUMAN RESOURCES. THE INTERVENTION WILL BE TESTED IN PRIMARY CARE CLINICS IN SAO PAULO, BRAZIL, AND IN SECONDARY CARE CLINICS IN LIMA, PERU. PILOT STUDIES WILL TAKE PLACE IN GUATEMALA, COLOMBIA AND ECUADOR. 2. TO BUILD INCREASED MENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH CAPACITY IN THE REGION THROUGH A RESEARCH TRAINING PROGRAM DELIVERED BY A NETWORK INVOLVING THE UNIVERSITY OF SAO PAULO IN BRAZIL, THE LATIN AMERICAN NETWORK FOR THE GLOBAL ALLIANCE FOR CHRONIC DISEASE, AND UNIVERSITIES OF WASHINGTON AND BRISTOL.

THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE INDIVIDUALS EXPOSED TO M. LEPRAE BECOMES INFECTED, BUT ONLY A SMALL PROPORTION OF THE INFECTED INDIVIDUALS EVOLVES TO ACTIVE DISEASE. PREVIOUS WORK IN LEPROSY AND TUBERCULOSIS DEMONSTRATED A MAJOR ROLE OF INTERFERON-, AN EFFECTOR CYTOKINE PRODUCED BY PATHOGEN-SPECIFIC MEMORY CD4 T CELLS, IN THE CONTROL OF THE INFECTION BY THESE INTRACELLULAR PATHOGENS. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA SHOW A PROGRESSIVE REDUCTION IN M. LEPRAE-SPECIFIC IFN LEVELS IN INDIVIDUALS THAT CORRELATES TO INDICATORS OF LEVEL OF EXPOSURE TO M. LEPRAE AND TO BACILLARY LOAD IN INDIVIDUALS WITH LEPROSY. WHEN WE EVALUATED THE INTERACTION OF M.

METABOLOMICS ANALYSES OF LESIONS AND SERA FROM LEPROSY PATIENTS ALSO DEMONSTRATED CLEAR DIFFERENCES IN THE PRESENCE OF POLYUNSATURATED FATTY ACID (PUFA) DERIVED LIPID MEDIATORS THAT CORRELATED TO THE CLINICAL FORMS OF LEPROSY AND BACILLARY LOADS.

THESE FACTORS INTERFERE WITH DEVELOPMENT, LIMIT OPPORTUNITIES, AND HAMPER ACHIEVEMENT OF A FULFILLING LIFE AS ADULTS. ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES CAN LEAD TO IMPROVED OUTCOMES AT THE POPULATION LEVEL AND BETTER COST-EFFECTIVENESS FOR HEALTH SERVICES. THIS SHOULD BE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES, DUE TO THE SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF FINANCIALLY AND SOCIALLY VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS IN THESE SETTINGS. CASH TRANSFER PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN A PROMISING WAY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE SOCIAL DRIVERS FOR POOR MENTAL HEALTH AMONG YOUTH. IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT SUCH PROGRAMS CAN ALLEVIATE INCOME RESTRICTION, INCREASE SCHOOLING AND ACCESS TO HEALTH FACILITIES, AND DECREASE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND VIOLENCE IN FAMILIES. HOWEVER, IT IS STILL UNCLEAR WHICH PATHWAYS AND MECHANISMS EXPLAIN THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SOCIOECONOMIC SUPPORT AND LOWER MENTAL ILLNESS AMONG YOUTH. IN THIS PROJECT, WE WILL EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF SOCIAL DRIVERS ON YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH-RELATED HOSPITALIZATIONS AND SUICIDE, TEST MECHANISMS AND PATHWAYS OF A COUNTRYWIDE SOCIOECONOMIC INTERVENTION, AND EXAMINE THE TIMING OF THE INTERVENTION DURING THE LIFE COURSE. FOR EXAMPLE, DETERMINING WHETHER CASH TRANSFERS DELIVERED EARLIER IN LIFE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO BETTER OUTCOMES OVER TIME. THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO INVESTIGATE THE CASH TRANSFER EFFECT ON VULNERABLE GROUPS (AFRICAN DESCENDANTS, WOMEN, AND YOUTH WITH LOWER INCOME). WE WILL EVALUATE SOCIAL DRIVERS’ DETERMINATION AND THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BEING BENEFICIARIES OF THE CONDITIONAL CASH TRANSFER PROGRAM, CALLED THE BOLSA FAMILIA PROGRAM (BFP), AND MENTAL ILLNESS AND ITS LONG-TERM EFFECTS USING ROBUST METHODOLOGIES FOR BIG DATASETS, SUCH AS REGRESSION DISCONTINUITY DESIGNS, PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING AND DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCES. WE WILL TEST MECHANISMS AND PATHWAYS, BETWEEN BFP AND MENTAL HEALTH-RELATED HOSPITALIZATIONS AND SUICIDE AMONG YOUTH USING STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING. FURTHERMORE, WE WILL PERFORM MICROSIMULATIONS TO GENERATE PROJECTIONS REGARDING HOW MENTAL HEALTH-RELATED HOSPITALIZATIONS AND SUICIDE TRENDS WILL BE IN THE FUTURE BASED ON THE CURRENT STATE, AND HOW BFP IMPLEMENTATION SCENARIOS WILL AFFECT THESE TRENDS. THE RESULTS OF THIS PROJECT WILL BE OF VITAL IMPORTANCE TO GUIDE POLICIES AND PROGRAMS TO IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH AND REDUCE MENTAL HEALTH-RELATED HOSPITALIZATIONS AND SUICIDE IN YOUTH. IT WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION TO IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE PROGRAMS WORLDWIDE.

THERE IS NO EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR CHRONIC CHAGAS DISEASE AND RESISTANT STRAINS TO THE CURRENT FRONTLINE TREATMENT HAVE ALREADY EMERGED. THERE IS A GROWING NEED FOR NEW PHARMACOLOGICAL ALTERNATIVES TO TREAT THIS DISEASE.  THIS PROPOSAL EXPLOITS A TARGET-BASED APPROACH TO SEARCH FOR LEAD COMPOUNDS AGAINST CHAGAS DISEASE. TRYPANOSOMA CRUZI DIHYDROOROTATE DEHYDROGENASE (TCDHODH) IS A FLAVIN MONONUCLEOTIDE CONTAINING ENZYME, WHICH CATALYZES THE OXIDATION OF L-DIHYDROOROTATE TO OROTATE, THE FOURTH STEP AND ONLY REDOX REACTION IN THE DE NOVO BIOSYNTHESIS OF PYRIMIDINE NUCLEOTIDES. TCDHODH WAS ALSO DESCRIBED AS A SOLUBLE FUMARATE REDUCTASE PLAYING A ROLE IN CONNECTING SUCCINATE/FUMARATE METABOLISM TO DE NOVO PYRIMIDINE BIOSYNTHESIS. DHODH HAS ALREADY BEEN EXTENSIVELY EXPLOITED AS A DRUG TARGET FOR PROLIFERATIVE AND PARASITIC DISEASES. GENETIC STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT DHODH IS ESSENTIAL FOR T. CRUZI SURVIVAL PROVIDING EVIDENCE THAT THIS ENZYME IS AN ATTRACTIVE TARGET FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANTICHAGASIC DRUGS.  THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO CHEMICALLY VALIDATE TCDHODH AS A NEW DRUG TARGET FOR CHAGAS DISEASE AND TO PROVIDE LEADS FOR DRUG DEVELOPMENT. OUR APPROACH COMBINES MULTIPLE TECHNIQUES INCLUDING COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY, ENZYMOLOGY, STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY, PARASITOLOGY, AND MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY TO DEVELOP SELECTIVE AND COVALENT INHIBITORS OF TCDHODH. INITIALLY, WE WILL SEEK TO GAIN A GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF THE DHODH HOT SPOTS BY USING SOLVENT MAPPING TO CHARACTERIZE THE BINDING POCKETS WITH THE FLEXIBLE ACTIVE-SITE LOOP OPEN AND CLOSED. THIS INFORMATION WILL HELP STRENGTHEN THE COMPUTATIONAL MODELING, AND SUBSEQUENT COMPOUND DESIGN.  COVALENT INHIBITION OF ENZYMES BASED ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF A SET OF CYSTEINE TARGETING COVALENT WARHEADS INCLUDING ACRYLAMIDES, VINYL SULFONES AND NITRILES, HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE A SUCCESSFUL APPROACH IN DRUG DISCOVERY PIPELINES. IN OUR PROPOSAL, AN INITIAL SET OF PUTATIVE INHIBITORS THAT INCORPORATE AN ACRYLAMIDE WARHEAD HAVE ALREADY BEEN RATIONALLY DESIGNED TO TARGET THE TCDHODH ACTIVE-SITE CYSTEINE. PREDICTED INHIBITORS WILL BE EVALUATED FOR INHIBITORY POTENCY AND MECHANISM OF INHIBITION AGAINST TCDHODH, CYTOTOXICITY AND ITS ANTI-PARASITIC EFFECTS IN CELL CULTURE. X-RAY CRYSTALLOGRAPHY, FRAGMENT SCREENING AND MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY WILL BE COMBINED TO PROVIDE THE CHEMICAL BASIS FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF A NEW GENERATION OF POTENT, SELECTIVE, AND DRUG-LIKE INHIBITORS.
