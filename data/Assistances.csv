TST MEASURES AN IN VIVO CELLULAR REACTION MEDIATED BY TH1 CELLS AT THE SITE OF TUBERCULIN INJECTION. ALTHOUGH TST DETECTS PREVIOUS EXPOSURE TO MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS (MTB), IT PRESENTS LOW SPECIFICITY AND IS NOT CAPABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE LATENT INFECTION FROM ACTIVE TB DISEASE. FEW YEARS AGO, THE IDENTIFICATION OF HIGHLY SPECIFIC RD1 REGION IN MTB GENOME DROVE THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW IN VITRO TB SPECIFIC TESTS. THE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE QUANTIFERON(R) TB GOLD IN TUBE6 IS AN EXAMPLE OF SUCH IN VITRO TESTS (ALSO KNOWN AS IGRA). IGRA DETECTS IFN- RELEASED FROM LYMPHOCYTES AFTER IN VITRO INCUBATION WITH MTB ANTIGENS. AS OPPOSED TO TST, IGRA OFFER ENHANCED SPECIFICITY AND ARE NOT INFLUENCED BY CROSS-REACTIVITY TO BCG AND OTHER NON-TUBERCULOUS MYCOBACTERIA (NTM). HOWEVER, IT IS STILL CONTROVERSIAL WHETHER IGRA CAN REPLACE TST AS THE DIAGNOSTIC TEST OF CHOICE. ALTHOUGH IGRA IS, BY DEFINITION, MORE SPECIFIC THAN TST, SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE REPORTED AN ELEVATED FREQUENCY OF IGRA REVERSIONS AND CONVERSIONS7-15 AS WELL AS DISCORDANCE BETWEEN IGRA AND TST 4, 16, 17.

THE P. VIVAX ORTHOLOGUE, CLONED AND EXPRESSED IN E. COLI, AS A ~60KDA RECOMBINANT PRODUCT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE HIGHLY ANTIGENIC AND IMMUNOGENIC. INDIVIDUALS EXPOSED TO P. VIVAX PRODUCE ABS TO PVS48/45 WHICH INCREASES IN AN AGE DEPENDENT MANNER, AND THOSE INDIVIDUALS WITH HIGHER A-PVS48/45 AB TITERS ALSO DISPLAY HIGH EX VIVO TB ACTIVITY. PILOT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE RPVS48/45 PROTEIN IS HIGHLY IMMUNOGENIC BOTH IN MICE AND MONKEYS AND ABS ELICITED HAVE THE CAPACITY TO EX VIVO BLOCK PARASITE TRANSMISSION TO MOSQUITOES. TOGETHER, ALL THESE DATA MAKE PVS48/45 A VERY PROMISING TB VACCINE CANDIDATE. THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DETERMINE THE VACCINE POTENTIAL OF RPVS48/45 FOR HUMAN USE.

BRUCELLA ABORTUS STRAIN 19 VACCINE, DEVELOPED IN THE 1930S, IS THE PRINCIPAL VACCINE USED TO PREVENT TRANSMISSION OF BRUCELLOSIS FROM CATTLE TO HUMANS WORLDWIDE AND IN BRAZIL. THE MECHANISMS THAT MEDIATE PROTECTION BY STRAIN 19 ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD. HOST MECHANISMS OF INNATE IMMUNITY INDUCED BY THE VACCINE THAT CONTROL INFECTION REMAIN OBSCURE. INDEED, THE VACCINE CONTAINS SEVERAL PROPERTIES THAT ARE INHIBITORY TO HOST IMMUNITY. OUR RESEARCH GROUP WAS THE FIRST TO IMPLICATE THE ROLE OF INFLAMMASOME RECEPTORS IN THE CONTROL OF BRUCELLA ABORTUS INFECTION. FURTHER, OUR TEAM HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT IFN-ASSR KO MICE ARE MORE RESISTANT TO INFECTION SUGGESTING THAT TYPE I IFN SIGNALING FAVORS BRUCELLA MULTIPLICATION IN THE HOST. THEREFORE, OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO RESOLVE THE CONUNDRUM OF HOW BRUCELLA ACTIVATES INNATE IMMUNE COMPONENTS THAT RESULTS IN HOST RESISTANCE VERSUS BACTERIAL SUBVERSION OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE. BRUCELLA SPP ARE ONE OF THE FEW BACTERIAL PATHOGENS THAT USE THE ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM (ER) AS ITS REPLICATIVE NICHE. THE UNFOLDED PROTEIN RESPONSE (UPR) IS A CONSERVED SIGNALING PATHWAY IN EUKARYOTES THAT MEDIATES CELLULAR ADAPTATION TO PROTEIN-FOLDING STRESS IN THE ER. THE UPR ALSO MODULATES INNATE IMMUNITY. RECENTLY, OUR COLLABORATORS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT BRUCELLA INDUCES THE UPR THAT ENABLES ITS INTRACELLULAR REPLICATION. BASED ON THESE COMPELLING PRELIMINARY DATA, WE PROPOSE TO TEST THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS THAT BRUCELLA ABORTUS STRAIN 19 ACTIVATES PROTECTIVE INNATE IMMUNE MEDIATORS AND TRIGGERS THE UPR TO SECURE INTRACELLULAR REPLICATION. FURTHER, WE PROPOSE THAT THE STRAIN 19 INDUCED UPR REGULATES CYTOKINE PRODUCTION. OUR SPECIFIC AIMS ARE TO DETERMINE WHETHER: 1) NLRP3 INFLAMMASOME ACTIVATION AND IL-1SS SECRETION INDUCED BY BRUCELLA REQUIRES THE UPR; 2) THE BACTERIAL VIRULENCE FACTOR SS TCPB THAT MODULATES HOST CELL MICROTUBULES ACTIVATES THE NLRP3 INFLAMMASOME AND IL-1SS AND 3) THE UPR ACTIVATED BY BRUCELLA ABORTUS STRAIN 19 REGULATES STING EXPRESSION AND TYPE I INTERFERON PRODUCTION TO FACILITATE BACTERIAL PERSISTENCE. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR APPROACH WILL SHED LIGHT ON THE MECHANISMS OF IMMUNITY AGAINST THIS IMPORTANT HUMAN AND ANIMAL PATHOGEN. ADDITIONALLY, CRITICAL INFORMATION GAINED FROM THESE SPECIFIC AIMS WILL BEGIN TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT MECHANISMS OF PROTECTION INDUCED BY B. ABORTUS VACCINE STRAIN 19 AND HOW BACTERIAL PERSISTENCE IS REGULATED.

THE UNFOLDED PROTEIN RESPONSE (UPR) IS A CONSERVED SIGNALING PATHWAY IN EUKARYOTES THAT MEDIATES CELLULAR ADAPTATION TO PROTEIN-FOLDING STRESS IN THE ER. THE UPR ALSO MODULATES INNATE IMMUNITY. RECENTLY, OUR COLLABORATORS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT BRUCELLA INDUCES THE UPR THAT ENABLES ITS INTRACELLULAR REPLICATION. BASED ON THESE COMPELLING PRELIMINARY DATA, WE PROPOSE TO TEST THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS THAT BRUCELLA ABORTUS STRAIN 19 ACTIVATES PROTECTIVE INNATE IMMUNE MEDIATORS AND TRIGGERS THE UPR TO SECURE INTRACELLULAR REPLICATION. FURTHER, WE PROPOSE THAT THE STRAIN 19 INDUCED UPR REGULATES CYTOKINE PRODUCTION. OUR SPECIFIC AIMS ARE TO DETERMINE WHETHER: 1) NLRP3 INFLAMMASOME ACTIVATION AND IL-1SS SECRETION INDUCED BY BRUCELLA REQUIRES THE UPR; 2) THE BACTERIAL VIRULENCE FACTOR SS TCPB THAT MODULATES HOST CELL MICROTUBULES ACTIVATES THE NLRP3 INFLAMMASOME AND IL-1SS AND 3) THE UPR ACTIVATED BY BRUCELLA ABORTUS STRAIN 19 REGULATES STING EXPRESSION AND TYPE I INTERFERON PRODUCTION TO FACILITATE BACTERIAL PERSISTENCE. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR APPROACH WILL SHED LIGHT ON THE MECHANISMS OF IMMUNITY AGAINST THIS IMPORTANT HUMAN AND ANIMAL PATHOGEN. ADDITIONALLY, CRITICAL INFORMATION GAINED FROM THESE SPECIFIC AIMS WILL BEGIN TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT MECHANISMS OF PROTECTION INDUCED BY B. ABORTUS VACCINE STRAIN 19 AND HOW BACTERIAL PERSISTENCE IS REGULATED. FINALLY, THE INVESTIGATORS ON THIS PROPOSAL HAVE A STRONG TRACK RECORD IN BRUCELLOSIS RESEARCH AND A UNIQUE COMBINATION OF KEY EXPERTISE IN WHOLE ANIMAL MODELS, IMMUNOLOGY, HUMAN BRUCELLOSIS, CELL BIOLOGY, AND ANALYSIS OF THE UPR.|BRUCELLA SURVIVAL STRATEGY REQUIRES ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM RESTRUCTURING AND INTERFERES WITH INNATE IMMUNITY - DESCRIPTION (PROVIDED BY APPLICANT): BRUCELLOSIS IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST FREQUENT ZOONOTIC DISEASES WITH OVER 500,000 NEW HUMAN INFECTIONS EVERY YEAR. BRUCELLA ABORTUS STRAIN 19 VACCINE, DEVELOPED IN THE 1930S, IS THE PRINCIPAL VACCINE USED TO PREVENT TRANSMISSION OF BRUCELLOSIS FROM CATTLE TO HUMANS WORLDWIDE AND IN BRAZIL. THE MECHANISMS THAT MEDIATE PROTECTION BY STRAIN 19 ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD. HOST MECHANISMS OF INNATE IMMUNITY INDUCED BY THE VACCINE THAT CONTROL INFECTION REMAIN OBSCURE. INDEED, THE VACCINE CONTAINS SEVERAL PROPERTIES THAT ARE INHIBITORY TO HOST IMMUNITY. OUR RESEARCH GROUP WAS THE FIRST TO IMPLICATE THE ROLE OF INFLAMMASOME RECEPTORS IN THE CONTROL OF BRUCELLA ABORTUS INFECTION. FURTHER, OUR TEAM HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT IFN-ASSR KO MICE ARE MORE RESISTANT TO INFECTION SUGGESTING THAT TYPE I IFN SIGNALING FAVORS BRUCELLA MULTIPLICATION IN THE HOST. THEREFORE, OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO RESOLVE THE CONUNDRUM OF HOW BRUCELLA ACTIVATES INNATE IMMUNE COMPONENTS THAT RESULTS IN HOST RESISTANCE VERSUS BACTERIAL SUBVERSION OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE.

THIS COMBINATION THERAPY DEMONSTRATED VERY HIGH EFFICACY IN CLINICAL TRIALS AND ACQUIRED DRUG RESISTANCE WAS ABSENT (FIRST-LINE TREATMENT) OR VERY RARE (SECOND-LINE TREATMENT). IT REMAINS TO BE DETERMINED WHETHER THIS HIGH EFFICACY AND LACK OF RESISTANCE DEVELOPMENT CAN BE EXTRAPOLATED TO TREATMENT OF NON-B SUBTYPE VIRUSES IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES WHERE MOST PLWH LIVE. OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO PROVIDE A SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR OPTIMAL LARGE-SCALE AND LONG-TERM TREATMENT OF PLWH WITH DTG. OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT NOVEL VIRAL MUTATIONS IN AND OUTSIDE THE INTEGRASE GENE (WITH AN EMPHASIS ON 3’-POLYPURINE TRACT CHANGES) CONTRIBUTE TO VIROLOGIC FAILURE WITH DTG IN CLINICAL PRACTICE. THIS HYPOTHESIS WILL BE TESTED BY IDENTIFYING PLWH FAILING DTG CONTAINING REGIMENS IN BRAZIL WHICH IS A MODEL COUNTRY FOR LARGE-SCALE DTG IMPLEMENTATION WHERE VARIOUS HIV SUBTYPES CO-CIRCULATE.

THE IPEC CRS IS COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT ALL OF ITS PROCESSES AND STANDARDS MEET OR SUPERSEDE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR DAIDS-SPONSORED NETWORKS, ICH/GCP STANDARDS, AND OTHER REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. THE CRS HAS NOT ONLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE GENERATION OF RESULTS THAT LED TO IMPROVED CARE AND TREATMENT FOR THOSE INFECTED WITH AND AFFECTED BY HIV, TUBERCULOSIS, AND HEPATITIS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED COMORBIDITIES, BUT ALSO TO THE LICENSURE APPLICATIONS FOR 11 NOVEL AGENTS. THE FIOTRIALS CTU AND THE IPEC CRS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY UNDERGONE REGULATORY INSPECTIONS FROM BOTH US (FDA) AND EUROPEAN (EMA) AUTHORITIES. FIOTRIALS AND THE IPEC CRS HAVE ESTABLISHED A SOLID RELATIONSHIP WITH THE LOCAL HIV/AIDS AND LGBTQI+ COMMUNITIES. OUR PROGRAM SUCCESS IS THE RESULT OF A DYNAMIC AND COLLABORATIVE PROCESS WITH DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS, SUCH AS STUDY PARTICIPANTS AND COMMUNITIES, COMMUNITY LEADERS AND ADVOCATES, NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, RESEARCHERS, RELEVANT GOVERNMENTAL BODIES, AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. THE CTU AND CRS TEAMS ARE COMPOSED OF INDIVIDUALS AND RESEARCHERS WITH DIVERSE SOCIAL AND PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUNDS, GENDER, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, RACE, BELIEFS, AND VALUES THAT WELL REPRESENT THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. DURING THIS NEXT FUNDING CYCLE, WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTRIBUTING TO THE SCIENTIFIC AND FUNCTIONAL GOALS OF THE ACTG, HPTN, AND HVTN NETWORKS. TOGETHER WITH OUR DAIDS NETWORK PARTNERS, WE AIM TO ENHANCE THE LANDSCAPE FOR HIV, TB, AND HEPATITIS TREATMENT AND PREVENTION.|2022-07-21|Department of Health and Human Services|National Institutes of Health|FUNDACAO OSWALDO CRUZ||BRAZIL|BRAZIL|||||||

CASH TRANSFER PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN A PROMISING WAY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE SOCIAL DRIVERS FOR POOR MENTAL HEALTH AMONG YOUTH. IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT SUCH PROGRAMS CAN ALLEVIATE INCOME RESTRICTION, INCREASE SCHOOLING AND ACCESS TO HEALTH FACILITIES, AND DECREASE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND VIOLENCE IN FAMILIES. HOWEVER, IT IS STILL UNCLEAR WHICH PATHWAYS AND MECHANISMS EXPLAIN THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SOCIOECONOMIC SUPPORT AND LOWER MENTAL ILLNESS AMONG YOUTH. IN THIS PROJECT, WE WILL EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF SOCIAL DRIVERS ON YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH-RELATED HOSPITALIZATIONS AND SUICIDE, TEST MECHANISMS AND PATHWAYS OF A COUNTRYWIDE SOCIOECONOMIC INTERVENTION, AND EXAMINE THE TIMING OF THE INTERVENTION DURING THE LIFE COURSE. FOR EXAMPLE, DETERMINING WHETHER CASH TRANSFERS DELIVERED EARLIER IN LIFE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO BETTER OUTCOMES OVER TIME.

TWO VACCINES ARE IN EARLY STAGE CLINICAL TRIALS AND BOTH TARGET DOMAINS WITHIN THE PROTEIN VAR2CSA, WHICH IS THE MAJOR SURFACE ANTIGEN EXPRESSED BY PLASMODIUM FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL ISOLATES. THIS PROTEIN BINDS TO RECEPTORS IN THE PLACENTA AND MEDIATES SEQUESTRATION OF INFECTED RED BLOOD CELLS (IRBCS), UNDERPINNING THE PATHOGENESIS OF PLACENTAL MALARIA. HOWEVER, VAR2CSA IS UNDER STRONG IMMUNE SELECTION AND IS HIGHLY POLYMORPHIC; THIS COMPROMISES VACCINE EFFICACY BY LIMITING THE BREADTH OF PROTECTION AGAINST DIVERSE ALLELES. POLYMORPHIC ANTIGENS PRESENT A UBIQUITOUS CHALLENGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MALARIA SUBUNIT VACCINES. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO A VACCINE AGAINST PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED MALARIA THAT TARGETS HIGHLY CONSERVED, SUBDOMINANT (EVEN CRYPTIC) EPITOPES. WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT THIS APPROACH IS THAT IT EXPLOITS A MECHANISM OF CROSS- SPECIES IMMUNITY, WHERE EPITOPES FROM ONE PLASMODIUM SPECIES ELICIT ROBUST, BROADLY NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES AGAINST STRUCTURALLY RELATED ANTIGENS FROM ANOTHER SPECIES. THIS MECHANISM WAS DISCOVERED RECENTLY IN COLOMBIAN AND BRAZILIAN POPULATIONS WHERE VAR2CSA ANTIBODIES CAN BE ACQUIRED OUTSIDE OF PREGNANCY FOLLOWING INFECTION WITH P. VIVAX, AND THESE ANTIBODIES BLOCKED SEQUESTRATION OF IRBCS USING IN VITRO CORRELATES OF PLACENTAL MALARIA. THE CROSS-REACTIVE EPITOPE IN P. VIVAX WAS MAPPED TO SUBDOMAIN (SD1) IN PVDBP AND HUMAN SD1-PURIFIED ANTIBODIES BLOCKED PARASITE ADHESION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A VACCINE TO PROTECT PREGNANT WOMEN FROM FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL MALARIA THAT IS BASED ON THE CROSS- REACTIVE EPITOPE IN VIVAX SD1. THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH SYNTHESIS OF THREE COMPLEMENTARY SPECIFIC AIMS. EPITOPES REQUIRED TO ELICIT FUNCTIONAL, CROSS-REACTIVE ANTIBODIES WILL BE IDENTIFIED IN AIM 1 THROUGH CONFORMATIONALLY CONSTRICTED PEPTIDE MICROARRAYS SCREENED WITH MOUSE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES (MABS) AND HUMAN MABS TO SD1 ISOLATED FROM COLOMBIAN STUDY POPULATIONS. EPITOPES WILL BE SYNTHESIZED AS PEPTIDE- CONJUGATES OR WITHIN ENGINEERED RECOMBINANT DOMAINS, AND IMMUNOGENICITY WILL BE OPTIMIZED IN AIM 2 TO PRODUCE ANTIBODIES WITH FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY AGAINST PARASITES THAT EXPRESS DIVERSE ALLELES OF VAR2CSA. IN THE THIRD AIM, THE CRYPTIC EPITOPES IN VAR2CSA RECOGNIZED BY THESE ANTIBODIES WILL BE MAPPED TO IDENTIFY THE TARGETS OF ANTIBODIES ELICITED BY AN SD1-DERIVED VACCINE. THE INTEGRATION OF THESE FINDINGS WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT INSIGHT INTO THE MECHANISM OF CROSS-SPECIES EPITOPE RECOGNITION, WHICH WILL SERVE AS THE BASIS FOR A VIVAX VACCINE AGAINST FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL MALARIA AND COULD BE APPLIED MORE BROADLY TO VACCINES AGAINST OTHER MALARIA ANTIGENS.|EXPLOITING CROSS-REACTIVE, CONSERVED EPITOPES IN PLASMODIUM VIVAX TO DEVELOP A VACCINE AGAINST FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL MALARIA. - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A VACCINE IS URGENTLY NEEDED TO PROTECT PREGNANT WOMEN FROM MALARIA INFECTION AND THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF THIS DISEASE ON MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH. TWO VACCINES ARE IN EARLY STAGE CLINICAL TRIALS AND BOTH TARGET DOMAINS WITHIN THE PROTEIN VAR2CSA, WHICH IS THE MAJOR SURFACE ANTIGEN EXPRESSED BY PLASMODIUM FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL ISOLATES. THIS PROTEIN BINDS TO RECEPTORS IN THE PLACENTA AND MEDIATES SEQUESTRATION OF INFECTED RED BLOOD CELLS (IRBCS), UNDERPINNING THE PATHOGENESIS OF PLACENTAL MALARIA. HOWEVER, VAR2CSA IS UNDER STRONG IMMUNE SELECTION AND IS HIGHLY POLYMORPHIC; THIS COMPROMISES VACCINE EFFICACY BY LIMITING THE BREADTH OF PROTECTION AGAINST DIVERSE ALLELES. POLYMORPHIC ANTIGENS PRESENT A UBIQUITOUS CHALLENGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MALARIA SUBUNIT VACCINES. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO A VACCINE AGAINST PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED MALARIA THAT TARGETS HIGHLY CONSERVED, SUBDOMINANT (EVEN CRYPTIC) EPITOPES. WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT THIS APPROACH IS THAT IT EXPLOITS A MECHANISM OF CROSS- SPECIES IMMUNITY, WHERE EPITOPES FROM ONE PLASMODIUM SPECIES ELICIT ROBUST, BROADLY NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES AGAINST STRUCTURALLY RELATED ANTIGENS FROM ANOTHER SPECIES. THIS MECHANISM WAS DISCOVERED RECENTLY IN COLOMBIAN AND BRAZILIAN POPULATIONS WHERE VAR2CSA ANTIBODIES CAN BE ACQUIRED OUTSIDE OF PREGNANCY FOLLOWING INFECTION WITH P. VIVAX, AND THESE ANTIBODIES BLOCKED SEQUESTRATION OF IRBCS USING IN VITRO CORRELATES OF PLACENTAL MALARIA. THE CROSS-REACTIVE EPITOPE IN P. VIVAX WAS MAPPED TO SUBDOMAIN (SD1) IN PVDBP AND HUMAN SD1-PURIFIED ANTIBODIES BLOCKED PARASITE ADHESION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A VACCINE TO PROTECT PREGNANT WOMEN FROM FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL MALARIA THAT IS BASED ON THE CROSS- REACTIVE EPITOPE IN VIVAX SD1.

THERE IS NO EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR CHRONIC CHAGAS DISEASE AND RESISTANT STRAINS TO THE CURRENT FRONTLINE TREATMENT HAVE ALREADY EMERGED. THERE IS A GROWING NEED FOR NEW PHARMACOLOGICAL ALTERNATIVES TO TREAT THIS DISEASE.  THIS PROPOSAL EXPLOITS A TARGET-BASED APPROACH TO SEARCH FOR LEAD COMPOUNDS AGAINST CHAGAS DISEASE. TRYPANOSOMA CRUZI DIHYDROOROTATE DEHYDROGENASE (TCDHODH) IS A FLAVIN MONONUCLEOTIDE CONTAINING ENZYME, WHICH CATALYZES THE OXIDATION OF L-DIHYDROOROTATE TO OROTATE, THE FOURTH STEP AND ONLY REDOX REACTION IN THE DE NOVO BIOSYNTHESIS OF PYRIMIDINE NUCLEOTIDES. TCDHODH WAS ALSO DESCRIBED AS A SOLUBLE FUMARATE REDUCTASE PLAYING A ROLE IN CONNECTING SUCCINATE/FUMARATE METABOLISM TO DE NOVO PYRIMIDINE BIOSYNTHESIS.

HEALTH AUTHORITIES HAVE CONFIRMED MORE THAN 500 DEATHS JUST IN BRAZIL IN THE LAST TWO YEARS, AND MORE THAN 150 INCIDENTS OF YFV OUTBREAKS IN 26 AFRICAN COUNTRIES WERE REPORTED TO THE WHO IN THE LAST 30 YEARS. YFV INFECTION CAUSES A FEBRILE FLU-LIKE ILLNESS, AND ABOUT 10-25% OF PATIENTS DEVELOP HEMORRHAGIC MANIFESTATIONS, KIDNEY AND LIVER DAMAGE THAT CAN RESULT IN DEATH. YFV SHOW SIMILARITIES COMPARED TO OTHER MEDICAL IMPORTANT FLAVIVIRUS AS DENGUE VIRUS (DENV) AND ZIKA VIRUS (ZIKV). THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS UNDERLYING THE PROPOSED WORK IS THAT IN GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS WHERE YFV CO-CIRCULATES WITH DENV AND ZIKV ENDEMIC FLAVIVIRUSES, COHORTS VACCINATED FOR YFV WILL EXHIBIT A STATISTICALLY DIFFERENT PATTERN OF INCIDENCE OF DENV AND ZIKV INFECTIONS (SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER OR GREATER) COMPARED TO UNVACCINATED CONTROLS, DUE TO VACCINE ELICITATION OF SERUM IGG ANTIBODIES CROSS-REACTIVE BETWEEN YFV AND DENV AND/OR ZIKV. IN VIEW OF THIS, THE AIMS OF THIS COLLABORATIVE PROJECT ARE TO: (I) INFORM ON THE COMPLEXITY AND MOLECULAR FEATURES OF THE ANTIBODY REPERTOIRE ELICITED BY YFV VACCINATION THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO YFV AND THOSE THAT CROSS-REACT WITH DENV-2 AND/OR ZIKV, (II) ISOLATE YFV-SPECIFIC MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES (MABS) WITH THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL, (III) EVALUATE THE ABILITY OF THESE MABS TO PROTECT AGAINST YFV, DENV AND ZIKV INFECTIONS OR TO INCREASE THE INFECTION THROUGH ANTIBODY DEPENDENT ENHANCEMENT (ADE), AND (IV) IDENTIFY THE EPITOPES TARGETED BY THE NEUTRALIZING AND CROSS-REACTIVE MABS.

COLLECTIVELY, THIS WORK WILL BE IMPORTANT TO DETERMINE THE EXISTENCE OF ADE-INDUCED BY YFV VACCINATION AND TO OPEN UP THE PERSPECTIVES TO DEVELOP VACCINATION STRATEGIES THAT MINIMIZE ADE RESPONSES BETWEEN YFV, ZIKV AND DENV AND ALSO THE DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE MAB THERAPEUTICS AGAINST YELLOW FEVER.|MOLECULAR ANALYSIS OF ANTIBODY REPERTOIRE ELICITED AFTER YELLOW FEVER VACCINATION - MOLECULAR ANALYSIS OF ANTIBODY REPERTOIRE ELICITED AFTER YELLOW FEVER VACCINATION EVEN THOUGH AN EFFECTIVE VACCINE AGAINST THE YELLOW FEVER VIRUS (YFV) EXIST A HIGH FREQUENCY OF GLOBAL YFV OUTBREAKS REPRESENT AN IMMINENT THREAT TO HUMAN HEALTH. HEALTH AUTHORITIES HAVE CONFIRMED MORE THAN 500 DEATHS JUST IN BRAZIL IN THE LAST TWO YEARS, AND MORE THAN 150 INCIDENTS OF YFV OUTBREAKS IN 26 AFRICAN COUNTRIES WERE REPORTED TO THE WHO IN THE LAST 30 YEARS. YFV INFECTION CAUSES A FEBRILE FLU-LIKE ILLNESS, AND ABOUT 10-25% OF PATIENTS DEVELOP HEMORRHAGIC MANIFESTATIONS, KIDNEY AND LIVER DAMAGE THAT CAN RESULT IN DEATH. YFV SHOW SIMILARITIES COMPARED TO OTHER MEDICAL IMPORTANT FLAVIVIRUS AS DENGUE VIRUS (DENV) AND ZIKA VIRUS (ZIKV). THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS UNDERLYING THE PROPOSED WORK IS THAT IN GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS WHERE YFV CO-CIRCULATES WITH DENV AND ZIKV ENDEMIC FLAVIVIRUSES, COHORTS VACCINATED FOR YFV WILL EXHIBIT A STATISTICALLY DIFFERENT PATTERN OF INCIDENCE OF DENV AND ZIKV INFECTIONS (SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER OR GREATER) COMPARED TO UNVACCINATED CONTROLS, DUE TO VACCINE ELICITATION OF SERUM IGG ANTIBODIES CROSS-REACTIVE BETWEEN YFV AND DENV AND/OR ZIKV. IN VIEW OF THIS, THE AIMS OF THIS COLLABORATIVE PROJECT ARE TO: (I) INFORM ON THE COMPLEXITY AND MOLECULAR FEATURES OF THE ANTIBODY REPERTOIRE ELICITED BY YFV VACCINATION THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO YFV AND THOSE THAT CROSS-REACT WITH DENV-2 AND/OR ZIKV, (II) ISOLATE YFV-SPECIFIC MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES (MABS) WITH THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL, (III) EVALUATE THE ABILITY OF THESE MABS TO PROTECT AGAINST YFV, DENV AND ZIKV INFECTIONS OR TO INCREASE THE INFECTION THROUGH ANTIBODY DEPENDENT ENHANCEMENT (ADE), AND (IV) IDENTIFY THE EPITOPES TARGETED BY THE NEUTRALIZING AND CROSS-REACTIVE MABS. OUR MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH WILL INCLUDE A SET OF ORIGINAL TOOLS FOR ANALYZING ADAPTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSES— DEVELOPED, PUBLISHED, AND PROTECTED BY TWO ISSUED US PATENTS AND CURRENTLY AVAILABLE ONLY AT UT AUSTIN—TO COMPREHENSIVELY IDENTIFY, AT HIGH THROUGHPUT, HIGH-AFFINITY HUMAN CROSS-REACTIVE SERUM ANTIBODIES AND DELINEATE THE MOLECULAR NATURE OF CROSS-REACTIVE ANTIBODY GENERATION.

THE LAST FIVE YEARS HAVE BEEN A VOLATILE PERIOD IN SOUTH AMERICA WITH THE MASSIVE EMERGENCE OF ZIKA AND ITS CONGENITAL SYNDROME, THE BRAZIL YELLOW FEVER OUTBREAK THAT THREATENED TO EXHAUST THE REGIONAL VACCINE STOCKPILE, THE VENEZUELAN CRISIS THAT LED TO SIGNIFICANT MIGRATION AND MEASLES OUTBREAKS, AND AN UNPRECEDENTED SURGE IN MALARIA CASES THAT CRIPPLED THE PROGRESS ACHIEVED IN MALARIA CONTROL. INDEED, PERU WAS AFFECTED BY THESE CHALLENGES AND SUFFERED ITS LARGEST DENGUE OUTBREAK ON RECORD WITH NEARLY 70,000 CASES AND 89 DEATHS AFTER THE SUDDEN 2017 COASTAL EL NIÑO EVENT. THEREFORE, TO STRENGTHEN EARLY DETECTION AND EFFECTIVE RESPONSES TO THESE EPIDEMIC THREATS, WE WILL PROVIDE ADVANCED MASTER’S AND DOCTORAL TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES TO MINISTRY OF HEALTH PERSONNEL. THIS WILL CREATE AN EPIDEMIOLOGY MASTER’S PROGRAM IN THE AMAZON BASIN AND STRENGTHEN OUR SATELLITE RESEARCH UNIT ON THE NORTHERN COAST OF PERU AND SECURE THE LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF OUR NEW EPIDEMIOLOGY DOCTORATE. THESE STRATEGIES WILL RESULT IN BETTER-TRAINED EPIDEMIOLOGISTS IN LARGER NUMBERS, AND PRESENT IN THE CRITICAL, HIGH-RISK AREAS WHERE THEY ARE NEEDED THE MOST. OUR OBJECTIVE WILL BE TO CONSOLIDATE AND SECURE A SELF-SUSTAINABLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE EPIDEMIOLOGY DOCTORATE IN PERU BY REPLICATING THE SUCCESSFUL MODEL OF OUR MASTER’S PROGRAM AND CREATING A CONTINUOUS PIPELINE OF EMERGING DISEASES EPIDEMIOLOGISTS TO RESPOND TO OUTBREAKS AND PREVENTION AND CONTROL EFFORTS. THE EXPECTED OUTCOMES FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS ARE: 1) 20 PHDS GRADUATES FROM THE PERU PROGRAM AND 12 MORE UNDER TRAINING WITH A STREAMLINED CURRICULA TO IMPROVE GRADUATION AND RESEARCH OUTCOMES, 2) 30 GRADUATES FROM A NEW, DECENTRALIZED EPIDEMIOLOGY MASTER’S PROGRAM IN IQUITOS AND 90 ADDITIONAL GRADUATES FROM OUR LIMA MASTER’S, ~15% CONDUCTING RESEARCH IN EMERGING DISEASES AND ~20% FROM THE PUBLIC SECTOR, 3) ONE DOCTORAL AND FIVE MASTER’S GRADUATES OF THE PERUVIAN CDC TRAINED JOINTLY WITH THE US CDC, 4) SIX HIGHLY-SELECTED PERUVIAN DOCTORATES TRAINED IN WORLD-CLASS PROGRAMS ABROAD, FOUR REINSERTED IN PERU IN PRODUCTIVE RESEARCH CAREERS, 5) A LARGE PIPELINE OF YOUNG PROFESSIONALS TRAINED AND ENGAGED IN EMERGING DISEASES RESEARCH VIA ON-SITE INTERNSHIPS (30) AND SHORT COURSES (150). EXPERIENCED RESEARCH LEADERS IN WORLD-CLASS INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS CAYETANO, SAN MARCOS, MINAS GERAIS AND JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITIES WILL PARTNER WITH PERU AND US CDC SUPPORTED BY A BROAD NETWORK OF 30 LOCAL AND FOREIGN ORGANIZATIONS WORKING IN PERU. THE PARTNERS OF THIS PROGRAM PROVIDE A UNIQUE, RICH AND NURTURING RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT WITH EXTENSIVE MULTI-YEAR GRANT FUNDING FROM THE NIH AND OTHER SOURCES THAT PROMOTES INNOVATION AND ADDRESSES HYPOTHESIS OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE, PARTICULARLY FOR ARBOVIROSIS, ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE, RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES. OUR TRACK RECORD DEMONSTRATES PROOF OF CONCEPT FOR THE PROPOSED GOALS AFTER CREATING AN EPIDEMIOLOGY MASTER’S AND DOCTORATE IN PERU, GRADUATING OVER 200 MASTER’S STUDENTS AND SPONSORING DOCTORAL TRAINING FOR 16 PERUVIAN SCIENTISTS AT PRESTIGIOUS US AND UK UNIVERSITIES. ALMOST 15% OF OUR MASTER’S STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY MOVED INTO PHD TRAINING, AND OUR FIRST COHORT ALONE HAS PUBLISHED >200 PAPERS AFTER GRADUATING, A FOUR-FOLD INCREASE YEAR COMPARED TO PRIOR COURSEWORK. MORE THAN HALF OF OUR DOCTORAL TRAINEES ABROAD HAVE GRADUATED AND STARTED PRODUCTIVE SCIENTIFIC CAREERS, AND OVERALL, THEY HAVE PUBLISHED AN AVERAGE OF 11 MANUSCRIPTS EACH. CURRENT AND FUTURE TRAINEES ARE LIKELY TO BE EVEN MORE PRODUCTIVE DUE TO ENHANCED RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES, IMPROVED COURSEWORK AND ADDED MENTORING.

THE LAST FIVE YEARS HAVE BEEN A VOLATILE PERIOD IN SOUTH AMERICA WITH THE MASSIVE EMERGENCE OF ZIKA AND ITS CONGENITAL SYNDROME, THE BRAZIL YELLOW FEVER OUTBREAK THAT THREATENED TO EXHAUST THE REGIONAL VACCINE STOCKPILE, THE VENEZUELAN CRISIS THAT LED TO SIGNIFICANT MIGRATION AND MEASLES OUTBREAKS, AND AN UNPRECEDENTED SURGE IN MALARIA CASES THAT CRIPPLED THE PROGRESS ACHIEVED IN MALARIA CONTROL. INDEED, PERU WAS AFFECTED BY THESE CHALLENGES AND SUFFERED ITS LARGEST DENGUE OUTBREAK ON RECORD WITH NEARLY 70,000 CASES AND 89 DEATHS AFTER THE SUDDEN 2017 COASTAL EL NIÑO EVENT. THEREFORE, TO STRENGTHEN EARLY DETECTION AND EFFECTIVE RESPONSES TO THESE EPIDEMIC THREATS, WE WILL PROVIDE ADVANCED MASTER’S AND DOCTORAL TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES TO MINISTRY OF HEALTH PERSONNEL. THIS WILL CREATE AN EPIDEMIOLOGY MASTER’S PROGRAM IN THE AMAZON BASIN AND STRENGTHEN OUR SATELLITE RESEARCH UNIT ON THE NORTHERN COAST OF PERU AND SECURE THE LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF OUR NEW EPIDEMIOLOGY DOCTORATE. THESE STRATEGIES WILL RESULT IN BETTER-TRAINED EPIDEMIOLOGISTS IN LARGER NUMBERS, AND PRESENT IN THE CRITICAL, HIGH-RISK AREAS WHERE THEY ARE NEEDED THE MOST.

IT IS ESTIMATED THAT 6MILLION PEOPLE ARE INFECTED BY T. CRUZI WORLDWIDE, WITH 70MILLION AT RISK OF INFECTION. THE MAJORITY OF T. CRUZI-CHRONICALLY INFECTED INDIVIDUALS REMAIN IN AN ASYMPTOMATIC CLINICAL FORM, NAMED INDETERMINATE, WHILE ABOUT 30% OF THE PATIENTS DEVELOP A SEVERE CARDIOMYOPATHY THAT LEADS TO OVER 10,000 DEATHS/YEAR. THERE IS NO VACCINE TO PREVENT CHD, NOR INTERVENTIONS THAT CAN PREVENT THE PROGRESSION OF CARDIOMYOPATHY. CHD CARDIOMYOPATHY IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF AN INFLAMMATORY REACTION, WHICH LEADS TO TISSUE DESTRUCTION AND PATHOLOGY. DESPITE THE COMPLEXITY OF THE HOST-PARASITE INTERACTION THAT LEADS TO CARDIOMIOPATHY, IT IS A CONSENSUS THAT HOST'S IMMUNE RESPONSE IS CRITICAL IN DETERMINING DISEASE OUTCOME. WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY SHOWN THAT THE INDETERMINATE AND CARDIAC CLINICAL FORMS OF CHD ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A PREDOMINANT EXPRESSION OF DOWN MODULATORY AND INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES, RESPECTIVELY. WE HAVE ALSO SHOWN THAT CD4-CD8- (DOUBLE- NEGATIVE – DN) T CELLS ARE MAJOR SOURCES OF THESE CYTOKINES IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC CHD (CCHD). IN ADDITION, WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT IN VITRO BLOCKING OF T. CRUZI-INDUCED DN T CELL ACTIVATION, THROUGH THE INHIBITION OF ANTIGEN PRESENTATION VIA CD1D, SHIFTS THE CYTOKINE EXPRESSION OF DN T CELLS FROM AN INFLAMMATORY TO A PREDOMINANTLY ANTI-INFLAMMATORY PROFILE. THUS, WE IDENTIFIED, FOR THE FIRST TIME, A CELL POPULATION THAT MAY BE A POTENTIAL TARGET FOR AN IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC APPROACH TO INHIBIT INFLAMMATION-INDUCED PATHOLOGY AND PREVENT CARDIOMYOPATHY DEVELOPMENT.

BY BRINGING TOGETHER A GROUP OF BRAZIL AND US- BASED SCIENTISTS WITH COMPLEMENTARY EXPERTISE, WE HOPE TO DISSECT THE ROLE OF DN T CELLS IN DISEASE PROGRESSION, WORKING TOWARDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF IMMUNOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS, FINDING BIOMARKERS OF DISEASE PROGRESSION, WHILE PERFORMING TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER AND SCIENTIFIC TRAINING AMONGST ALL INVOLVED INSTITUTIONS.|ROLE OF CD4-CD8- DN T CELLS IN CHAGAS CARDIOMYOPATHY - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT CHAGAS DISEASE (CHD) IS A PARASITIC DISEASE CAUSED BY THE INFECTION WITH THE PROTOZOAN TRYPANOSOMA CRUZI.

IN THIS MANNER, THE PROJECT OFFERS AS A PRINCIPAL INNOVATIVE ASPECT THE GOAL OF APPLYING THESE INSTRUMENTS IN A COMPLEX CULTURAL/TERRITORIAL LEVEL AND WITH THE PERSPECTIVE OF INTEGRATION WITH OTHER PROTECTED AREAS, SUCH AS OFFICIAL CONSERVATION AREAS. THE MAIN OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT ARE TO IMPROVE THE GOVERNANCE, MANAGEMENT AND PROTECTION OF INDIGENOUS LANDS IN THE FOCUS REGION BY EQUIPPING THEM WITH MANAGEMENT TOOLS SO THAT THEY ARE BETTER ABLE TO RESIST PRESSURES IN SURROUNDING AREAS; ARTICULATE ACTIONS WITH THE MANAGERS OF CONSERVATION AREAS IN THE REGION, SEEKING TO ACT IN A BROADER LANDSCAPE CONTEXT; STRENGTHENING INDIGENOUS ORGANIZATIONS IN THE REGION, SO THAT THESE GROUPS HAVE MORE CAPILLARITY, CAPACITY, OUTSIDE RECOGNITION AND VISIBILITY TO ADVOCATE FOR INDIGENOUS RIGHTS AND TO CARRY OUT ARTICULATION WITH NEW PARTNERS; AND RUN A SMALL AND MICRO GRANTS FUND TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY WELL-BEING AND SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES IN INDIGENOUS LANDS.  THE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE GOING TO BE CARRIED OUT ARE:
 -ETHNO-ZONING OF THE RIO PINDARÉ IL, PGTA OF THE CARU TI, RESTRUCTURING OF THE CACIQUE CHICÃO INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE CENTER ON THE ARARIBOIA TI AS A SPACE FOR APPRECIATION AND DISSEMINATION OF GUAJAJARA CULTURAL MANIFESTATIONS AND FOR DISCUSSIONS ON ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT, ARE PLANNED. 
 - STRENGTHENING OF THE COORDINATION OF ORGANIZATIONS AND ARTICULATIONS OF THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLES OF MARANHÃO   COAPIMA, THAT REPRESENTS TEN INDIGENOUS PEOPLES OF MARANHÃO BY SUPPORTING ASSEMBLIES, ARTICULATION MEETINGS IN THE VILLAGES, ARTICULATION MEETINGS WITH STATE, MUNICIPAL AND FEDERAL AGENCIES, IN ADDITION TO SUPPORT FOR MAINTAINING CERTAIN ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND EQUIPMENT PURCHASE. 
 - STRENGTHENING OF THE ARTICULATION OF INDIGENOUS WOMEN OF MARANHÃO   AMIMA, CURRENTLY HOUSED IN COAPIMA,  THAT REPRESENTS ALL THE INDIGENOUS WOMEN IN THE STATE. STRENGTHENING WILL TAKE PLACE BY SUPPORT FOR POLICY ARTICULATION AND HOLDING OF ASSEMBLIES, AMONG OTHER ASPECTS. 
 - A SMALL AND MICRO GRANTS FUND FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND TERRITORIAL MANAGEMENT TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY PROJECTS. THERE ARE GOING TO BE TWO GRANT SUPPORT CYCLES, INTERSPERSED WITH ACTIVITIES FOR PLANNING, MONITORING AND ORIENTATION OF ACTIONS TOGETHER WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES. THE FUND WILL FUNCTION WITH MECHANISMS ESTABLISHED BY ISPN FOR THIS FINANCING MODALITY, ACCORDING TO THE FOLLOWING STEPS: 
 - BEFORE LAUNCHING THE CALL FOR PROPOSALS, WORKSHOPS AND MEETINGS ARE HELD TO DISSEMINATE AND BUILD CAPACITY ON PROJECT PREPARATION WITH INDIGENOUS ORGANIZATIONS IN THE REGION.
 -AFTER LAUNCHING THE CALL FOR PROPOSALS, PROPOSALS RECEIVED ARE SCREENED TO VERIFY IF THE INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED ARE COMPLETE. 
 -PROPOSALS ARE ANALYZED BY A SELECTION COMMITTEE COMPOSED OF PROFESSIONALS WITH SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL EXPERIENCE AND FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS, INCLUDING REPRESENTATIVES FROM ISPN, CTI, COAPIMA AND WYTY CATË. 
 -PROPONENTS FROM SELECTED PROJECTS ARE CALLED TO PARTICIPATE IN AN INITIAL CAPACITY BUILDING WORKSHOP, WHERE WORK PLANS AND PROJECT BUDGETS ARE CONSOLIDATED TOGETHER WITH ISPN TECHNICAL STAFF. AFTER PARTICIPATION IN THE WORKSHOP, PROJECTS PROCEED TO CONTRACT SIGNATURE WITH ISPN/CTI. 
 -THE FIRST TRANCHE IS DEPOSITED IN THE ACCOUNT OF THE PROJECT PROPONENT SO THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROJECT CAN BEGIN. WHEN THE PROJECT REACHES 70% OF THE AMOUNT SPENT OF THE TRANCHE RECEIVED, AS TESTIFIED BY THE PERFORMANCE REPORT, THE NEXT TRANCHE CAN BE REQUESTED.  
 -AFTER RECEIVING THE SEMI-FINAL REPORT, WITH INDICATORS SHOWING THAT THE OBJECTIVES WERE ACHIEVED, THE LAST (RESIDUAL) TRANCHE IS PAID, GIVEN THAT THE FINAL REPORT COULD CONTAIN SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO PROJECT CLOSING."|INSTITUTO SPN SOCIEDADE POPULACAO E NATUREZA|BRAZIL

BEATRIZ GRINSZTEJN AND SUPPORTED BY A CADRE OF EXPERIENCED RESEARCHERS AND PROMISING JUNIOR INVESTIGATORS. FIOTRIALS IS AFFILIATED WITH FIOCRUZ, AN INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF EXCELLENCE IN THE FIELD OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES. THE FIOTRIALS CTU PROMOTES AND REWARDS INNOVATION, WHILE PROVIDING A STANDARDIZED, FORMAL APPROACH TO THE IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT OF CLINICAL TRIALS. THE CTU HAS SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED AND CONDUCTED PIVOTAL CLINICAL TRIALS FOR MULTIPLE NIH-SPONSORED NETWORKS THAT HAVE CHANGED THE LANDSCAPE OF HIV AND TUBERCULOSIS (TB) PREVENTION AND TREATMENT DURING THE LAST 14 YEARS. THE FIOTRIALS CLINICAL RESEARCH SITE (CRS), INSTITUTO DE PESQUISA CLINICA EVANDRO CHAGAS (IPEC CRS), HAS CREATED AN EXTENSIVE RECORD OF ACCOMPLISHMENT IN CONDUCTING CLINICAL RESEARCH AT A HOSPITAL-BASED SETTING AND HAS CONTINUOUSLY PROVEN TO BE AN ELITE PERFORMER CRS. THE IPEC CRS IS COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT ALL OF ITS PROCESSES AND STANDARDS MEET OR SUPERSEDE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR DAIDS-SPONSORED NETWORKS, ICH/GCP STANDARDS, AND OTHER REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. THE CRS HAS NOT ONLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE GENERATION OF RESULTS THAT LED TO IMPROVED CARE AND TREATMENT FOR THOSE INFECTED WITH AND AFFECTED BY HIV, TUBERCULOSIS, AND HEPATITIS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED COMORBIDITIES, BUT ALSO TO THE LICENSURE APPLICATIONS FOR 11 NOVEL AGENTS. THE FIOTRIALS CTU AND THE IPEC CRS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY UNDERGONE REGULATORY INSPECTIONS FROM BOTH US (FDA) AND EUROPEAN (EMA) AUTHORITIES.

THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE INDIVIDUALS EXPOSED TO M. LEPRAE BECOMES INFECTED, BUT ONLY A SMALL PROPORTION OF THE INFECTED INDIVIDUALS EVOLVES TO ACTIVE DISEASE. PREVIOUS WORK IN LEPROSY AND TUBERCULOSIS DEMONSTRATED A MAJOR ROLE OF INTERFERON-, AN EFFECTOR CYTOKINE PRODUCED BY PATHOGEN-SPECIFIC MEMORY CD4 T CELLS, IN THE CONTROL OF THE INFECTION BY THESE INTRACELLULAR PATHOGENS. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA SHOW A PROGRESSIVE REDUCTION IN M. LEPRAE-SPECIFIC IFN LEVELS IN INDIVIDUALS THAT CORRELATES TO INDICATORS OF LEVEL OF EXPOSURE TO M. LEPRAE AND TO BACILLARY LOAD IN INDIVIDUALS WITH LEPROSY. WHEN WE EVALUATED THE INTERACTION OF M.

THESE FACTORS INTERFERE WITH DEVELOPMENT, LIMIT OPPORTUNITIES, AND HAMPER ACHIEVEMENT OF A FULFILLING LIFE AS ADULTS. ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES CAN LEAD TO IMPROVED OUTCOMES AT THE POPULATION LEVEL AND BETTER COST-EFFECTIVENESS FOR HEALTH SERVICES. THIS SHOULD BE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES, DUE TO THE SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF FINANCIALLY AND SOCIALLY VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS IN THESE SETTINGS. CASH TRANSFER PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN A PROMISING WAY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE SOCIAL DRIVERS FOR POOR MENTAL HEALTH AMONG YOUTH. IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT SUCH PROGRAMS CAN ALLEVIATE INCOME RESTRICTION, INCREASE SCHOOLING AND ACCESS TO HEALTH FACILITIES, AND DECREASE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND VIOLENCE IN FAMILIES. HOWEVER, IT IS STILL UNCLEAR WHICH PATHWAYS AND MECHANISMS EXPLAIN THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SOCIOECONOMIC SUPPORT AND LOWER MENTAL ILLNESS AMONG YOUTH. IN THIS PROJECT, WE WILL EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF SOCIAL DRIVERS ON YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH-RELATED HOSPITALIZATIONS AND SUICIDE, TEST MECHANISMS AND PATHWAYS OF A COUNTRYWIDE SOCIOECONOMIC INTERVENTION, AND EXAMINE THE TIMING OF THE INTERVENTION DURING THE LIFE COURSE. FOR EXAMPLE, DETERMINING WHETHER CASH TRANSFERS DELIVERED EARLIER IN LIFE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO BETTER OUTCOMES OVER TIME. THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO INVESTIGATE THE CASH TRANSFER EFFECT ON VULNERABLE GROUPS (AFRICAN DESCENDANTS, WOMEN, AND YOUTH WITH LOWER INCOME). WE WILL EVALUATE SOCIAL DRIVERS’ DETERMINATION AND THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BEING BENEFICIARIES OF THE CONDITIONAL CASH TRANSFER PROGRAM, CALLED THE BOLSA FAMILIA PROGRAM (BFP), AND MENTAL ILLNESS AND ITS LONG-TERM EFFECTS USING ROBUST METHODOLOGIES FOR BIG DATASETS, SUCH AS REGRESSION DISCONTINUITY DESIGNS, PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING AND DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCES. WE WILL TEST MECHANISMS AND PATHWAYS, BETWEEN BFP AND MENTAL HEALTH-RELATED HOSPITALIZATIONS AND SUICIDE AMONG YOUTH USING STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING. FURTHERMORE, WE WILL PERFORM MICROSIMULATIONS TO GENERATE PROJECTIONS REGARDING HOW MENTAL HEALTH-RELATED HOSPITALIZATIONS AND SUICIDE TRENDS WILL BE IN THE FUTURE BASED ON THE CURRENT STATE, AND HOW BFP IMPLEMENTATION SCENARIOS WILL AFFECT THESE TRENDS. THE RESULTS OF THIS PROJECT WILL BE OF VITAL IMPORTANCE TO GUIDE POLICIES AND PROGRAMS TO IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH AND REDUCE MENTAL HEALTH-RELATED HOSPITALIZATIONS AND SUICIDE IN YOUTH. IT WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION TO IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE PROGRAMS WORLDWIDE.

THE CO-PRINCIPAL DIRECTORS, DR. RUTH MACKLIN AND DR. FLORENCIA LUNA, HAVE BUILT ON PAST EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES AND OTHER FEATURES OF THE TRAINING PROGRAM, NOW IN ITS TENTH YEAR. CONTINUING FROM THE LAST FOUR-YEAR RENEWAL ARE: (1) FORMAL COURSES IN WHICH THE TRAINEES ENROLL DURING THEIR FOUR-MONTH STAY IN BUENOS AIRES; (2) A BRIEF, THREE-SESSION INTERNAL SEMINAR IN WHICH DRS. LUNA AND MACKLIN INTRODUCE THE TRAINEES TO THE PRINCIPLES OF BIOETHICS AND MAJOR INTERNATIONAL DOCUMENTS IN RESEARCH ETHICS; (3) AN ANNUAL ONE-WEEK SEMINAR WITH RENOWNED GUEST FACULTY; (4) A SIXTEEN-WEEK, DISTANCE-LEARNING COURSE OUR LONG-TERM TRAINEES BEGIN WHEN THEY RETURN TO THEIR HOME INSTITUTIONS; (5) ROTATIONS BY THE TRAINEES AMONG SIX RESEARCH ETHICS COMMITTEES AT BUENOS AIRES HOSPITALS AND RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS; (6) MENTORING BY DR. LUNA ON THEIR EXPERIENCE OBSERVING THESE RESEARCH ETHICS COMMITTEES; (7) TRAINEES' PLANS FOR A PRACTICUM TO IMPLEMENT SOME ASPECT OF WHAT THEY HAVE LEARNED WHEN THEY RETURN TO THEIR HOME INSTITUTIONS; (8) IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRACTICUM AT THEIR HOME INSTITUTIONS; (9) MENTORING SESSIONS WITH DR. MACKLIN DURING THEIR STAY, LEADING UP TO A FINAL RESEARCH PAPER (NEWLY REQUIRED FOR THE DIPLOMA); (10) COMPLETION OF THE FINAL PAPER FOR THE DIPLOMA UNDER DR. MACKLIN'S SUPERVISION. INNOVATIONS IN THE NEW PROGRAM ARE: I) PROVIDING ENHANCED EDUCATIONAL AND CREDENTIALING OPPORTUNITIES FOR CURRENT AND PAST TRAINEES; II) DEVELOPING AND ESTABLISHING A MASTER'S DEGREE IN BIOETHICS AT FLACSO; III) LENGTHENING THE DURATION OF THE TRAINING PROGRAM FROM TEN MONTHS TO ONE YEAR FOR EACH COHORT OF TRAINEES; IV) CHANGING THE CONTENTS OF THE ANNUAL ONE-WEEK SEMINAR EACH YEAR TO ENABLE ATTENDEES FROM THE BUENOS AIRES AREA TO PARTICIPATE EVERY YEAR WITHOUT ENCOUNTERING REDUNDANCY IN TOPICS; V) INVOLVING PAST TRAINEES IN A SYSTEMATIC PLAN TO MENTOR NEW TRAINEES IN THEIR PRACTICAL PROJECT DEVELOPED DURING THE TRAINING YEAR; VI) SHARING LEADERSHIP OF THE PROGRAM EQUALLY BETWEEN DRS.

TWO VACCINES ARE IN EARLY STAGE CLINICAL TRIALS AND BOTH TARGET DOMAINS WITHIN THE PROTEIN VAR2CSA, WHICH IS THE MAJOR SURFACE ANTIGEN EXPRESSED BY PLASMODIUM FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL ISOLATES. THIS PROTEIN BINDS TO RECEPTORS IN THE PLACENTA AND MEDIATES SEQUESTRATION OF INFECTED RED BLOOD CELLS (IRBCS), UNDERPINNING THE PATHOGENESIS OF PLACENTAL MALARIA. HOWEVER, VAR2CSA IS UNDER STRONG IMMUNE SELECTION AND IS HIGHLY POLYMORPHIC; THIS COMPROMISES VACCINE EFFICACY BY LIMITING THE BREADTH OF PROTECTION AGAINST DIVERSE ALLELES. POLYMORPHIC ANTIGENS PRESENT A UBIQUITOUS CHALLENGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MALARIA SUBUNIT VACCINES. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO A VACCINE AGAINST PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED MALARIA THAT TARGETS HIGHLY CONSERVED, SUBDOMINANT (EVEN CRYPTIC) EPITOPES. WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT THIS APPROACH IS THAT IT EXPLOITS A MECHANISM OF CROSS- SPECIES IMMUNITY, WHERE EPITOPES FROM ONE PLASMODIUM SPECIES ELICIT ROBUST, BROADLY NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES AGAINST STRUCTURALLY RELATED ANTIGENS FROM ANOTHER SPECIES. THIS MECHANISM WAS DISCOVERED RECENTLY IN COLOMBIAN AND BRAZILIAN POPULATIONS WHERE VAR2CSA ANTIBODIES CAN BE ACQUIRED OUTSIDE OF PREGNANCY FOLLOWING INFECTION WITH P. VIVAX, AND THESE ANTIBODIES BLOCKED SEQUESTRATION OF IRBCS USING IN VITRO CORRELATES OF PLACENTAL MALARIA. THE CROSS-REACTIVE EPITOPE IN P.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A VACCINE TO PROTECT PREGNANT WOMEN FROM FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL MALARIA THAT IS BASED ON THE CROSS- REACTIVE EPITOPE IN VIVAX SD1. THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH SYNTHESIS OF THREE COMPLEMENTARY SPECIFIC AIMS. EPITOPES REQUIRED TO ELICIT FUNCTIONAL, CROSS-REACTIVE ANTIBODIES WILL BE IDENTIFIED IN AIM 1 THROUGH CONFORMATIONALLY CONSTRICTED PEPTIDE MICROARRAYS SCREENED WITH MOUSE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES (MABS) AND HUMAN MABS TO SD1 ISOLATED FROM COLOMBIAN STUDY POPULATIONS. EPITOPES WILL BE SYNTHESIZED AS PEPTIDE- CONJUGATES OR WITHIN ENGINEERED RECOMBINANT DOMAINS, AND IMMUNOGENICITY WILL BE OPTIMIZED IN AIM 2 TO PRODUCE ANTIBODIES WITH FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY AGAINST PARASITES THAT EXPRESS DIVERSE ALLELES OF VAR2CSA. IN THE THIRD AIM, THE CRYPTIC EPITOPES IN VAR2CSA RECOGNIZED BY THESE ANTIBODIES WILL BE MAPPED TO IDENTIFY THE TARGETS OF ANTIBODIES ELICITED BY AN SD1-DERIVED VACCINE.

WE WILL COMPLEMENT THIS WORK WITH AN INNOVATIVE SYSTEM OF MENTORING.|2021-11-11|Department of Health and Human Services|National Institutes of Health|FACULTAD LATINOAMERICANA DE CIENCIAS SOCIALES||ARGENTINA|ARGENTINA|FLASCO|167094.00|2014-01-24|sub-grant|THIS TRAINING PROGRAM IN RESEARCH ETHICS IS A RENEWAL OF A PROGRAM THAT TAKES PLACE AT FLACSO (FACULTAD LATINOAMERICANA DE CIENCIAS SOCIALES--LATIN AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF SOCIAL SCIENCES) IN BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA. THE CO-PRINCIPAL DIRECTORS, DR. RUTH MACKLIN AND DR. FLORENCIA LUNA, HAVE BUILT ON PAST EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES AND OTHER FEATURES OF THE TRAINING PROGRAM, NOW IN ITS TENTH YEAR. CONTINUING FROM THE LAST FOUR-YEAR RENEWAL ARE: (1) FORMAL COURSES IN WHICH THE TRAINEES ENROLL DURING THEIR FOUR-MONTH STAY IN BUENOS AIRES; (2) A BRIEF, THREE-SESSION INTERNAL SEMINAR IN WHICH DRS. LUNA AND MACKLIN INTRODUCE THE TRAINEES TO THE PRINCIPLES OF BIOETHICS AND MAJOR INTERNATIONAL DOCUMENTS IN RESEARCH ETHICS; (3) AN ANNUAL ONE-WEEK SEMINAR WITH RENOWNED GUEST FACULTY; (4) A SIXTEEN-WEEK, DISTANCE-LEARNING COURSE OUR LONG-TERM TRAINEES BEGIN WHEN THEY RETURN TO THEIR HOME INSTITUTIONS; (5) ROTATIONS BY THE TRAINEES AMONG SIX RESEARCH ETHICS COMMITTEES AT BUENOS AIRES HOSPITALS AND RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS; (6) MENTORING BY DR. LUNA ON THEIR EXPERIENCE OBSERVING THESE RESEARCH ETHICS COMMITTEES; (7) TRAINEES' PLANS FOR A PRACTICUM TO IMPLEMENT SOME ASPECT OF WHAT THEY HAVE LEARNED WHEN THEY RETURN TO THEIR HOME INSTITUTIONS; (8) IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRACTICUM AT THEIR HOME INSTITUTIONS; (9) MENTORING SESSIONS WITH DR. MACKLIN DURING THEIR STAY, LEADING UP TO A FINAL RESEARCH PAPER (NEWLY REQUIRED FOR THE DIPLOMA); (10) COMPLETION OF THE FINAL PAPER FOR THE DIPLOMA UNDER DR. MACKLIN'S SUPERVISION. INNOVATIONS IN THE NEW PROGRAM ARE: I) PROVIDING ENHANCED EDUCATIONAL AND CREDENTIALING OPPORTUNITIES FOR CURRENT AND PAST TRAINEES; II) DEVELOPING AND ESTABLISHING A MASTER'S DEGREE IN BIOETHICS AT FLACSO; III) LENGTHENING THE DURATION OF THE TRAINING PROGRAM FROM TEN MONTHS TO ONE YEAR FOR EACH COHORT OF TRAINEES; IV) CHANGING THE CONTENTS OF THE ANNUAL ONE-WEEK SEMINAR EACH YEAR TO ENABLE ATTENDEES FROM THE BUENOS AIRES AREA TO PARTICIPATE EVERY YEAR WITHOUT ENCOUNTERING REDUNDANCY IN TOPICS; V) INVOLVING PAST TRAINEES IN A SYSTEMATIC PLAN TO MENTOR NEW TRAINEES IN THEIR PRACTICAL PROJECT DEVELOPED DURING THE TRAINING YEAR; VI) SHARING LEADERSHIP OF THE PROGRAM EQUALLY BETWEEN DRS. LUNA AND MACKLIN AS CO-PRINCIPAL DIRECTORS (CO-PDS) OF THE TRAINING PROGRAM.|FACULTAD LATINOAMERICANA DE CIENCIAS SOCIALES|ARGENTINA

THERE IS NO EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR CHRONIC CHAGAS DISEASE AND RESISTANT STRAINS TO THE CURRENT FRONTLINE TREATMENT HAVE ALREADY EMERGED. THERE IS A GROWING NEED FOR NEW PHARMACOLOGICAL ALTERNATIVES TO TREAT THIS DISEASE.  THIS PROPOSAL EXPLOITS A TARGET-BASED APPROACH TO SEARCH FOR LEAD COMPOUNDS AGAINST CHAGAS DISEASE. TRYPANOSOMA CRUZI DIHYDROOROTATE DEHYDROGENASE (TCDHODH) IS A FLAVIN MONONUCLEOTIDE CONTAINING ENZYME, WHICH CATALYZES THE OXIDATION OF L-DIHYDROOROTATE TO OROTATE, THE FOURTH STEP AND ONLY REDOX REACTION IN THE DE NOVO BIOSYNTHESIS OF PYRIMIDINE NUCLEOTIDES. TCDHODH WAS ALSO DESCRIBED AS A SOLUBLE FUMARATE REDUCTASE PLAYING A ROLE IN CONNECTING SUCCINATE/FUMARATE METABOLISM TO DE NOVO PYRIMIDINE BIOSYNTHESIS. DHODH HAS ALREADY BEEN EXTENSIVELY EXPLOITED AS A DRUG TARGET FOR PROLIFERATIVE AND PARASITIC DISEASES. GENETIC STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT DHODH IS ESSENTIAL FOR T. CRUZI SURVIVAL PROVIDING EVIDENCE THAT THIS ENZYME IS AN ATTRACTIVE TARGET FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANTICHAGASIC DRUGS.  THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO CHEMICALLY VALIDATE TCDHODH AS A NEW DRUG TARGET FOR CHAGAS DISEASE AND TO PROVIDE LEADS FOR DRUG DEVELOPMENT. OUR APPROACH COMBINES MULTIPLE TECHNIQUES INCLUDING COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY, ENZYMOLOGY, STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY, PARASITOLOGY, AND MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY TO DEVELOP SELECTIVE AND COVALENT INHIBITORS OF TCDHODH. INITIALLY, WE WILL SEEK TO GAIN A GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF THE DHODH HOT SPOTS BY USING SOLVENT MAPPING TO CHARACTERIZE THE BINDING POCKETS WITH THE FLEXIBLE ACTIVE-SITE LOOP OPEN AND CLOSED. THIS INFORMATION WILL HELP STRENGTHEN THE COMPUTATIONAL MODELING, AND SUBSEQUENT COMPOUND DESIGN.  COVALENT INHIBITION OF ENZYMES BASED ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF A SET OF CYSTEINE TARGETING COVALENT WARHEADS INCLUDING ACRYLAMIDES, VINYL SULFONES AND NITRILES, HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE A SUCCESSFUL APPROACH IN DRUG DISCOVERY PIPELINES.

THEREFORE, TO STRENGTHEN EARLY DETECTION AND EFFECTIVE RESPONSES TO THESE EPIDEMIC THREATS, WE WILL PROVIDE ADVANCED MASTER’S AND DOCTORAL TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES TO MINISTRY OF HEALTH PERSONNEL. THIS WILL CREATE AN EPIDEMIOLOGY MASTER’S PROGRAM IN THE AMAZON BASIN AND STRENGTHEN OUR SATELLITE RESEARCH UNIT ON THE NORTHERN COAST OF PERU AND SECURE THE LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF OUR NEW EPIDEMIOLOGY DOCTORATE.

 THE NATIONAL POLICY FOR THE TERRITORIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT OF INDIGENOUS LANDS (PNGATI) OF 2012 IS AN IMPORTANT FRAMEWORK FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF INDIGENOUS LANDS IN BRAZIL. THE MAIN CONSTRAINTS TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PNGATI IN THE SOUTH OF AMAZONAS STATE ARE A LACK OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND TECHNICAL EXPERTISE IN THE WRITING AND ADMINISTRATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND PRODUCTIVE PROJECTS BY INDIGENOUS ORGANIZATIONS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THEIR TERRITORIES.
 
 THIS PROJECT DIRECTLY ADDRESSES THESE CONSTRAINTS IN AN EFFORT TO CATALYZE AN INCIPIENT PROCESS OF TERRITORIAL MANAGEMENT BY LOCAL INDIGENOUS ORGANIZATIONS. BY DESIGNING A SMALL GRANTS PROGRAM THAT ATTENDS TO THE MOST IMMEDIATE MANAGEMENT NEEDS OF INDIGENOUS LANDS IN THE REGION THROUGH THE ACTIVE PARTICIPATION OF LOCAL INDIGENOUS LEADERS, A CRUCIAL INFLUX OF FINANCING FOR SMALL PROJECTS TO ALLOW THESE ORGANIZATIONS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE DIFFICULT PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING PNGATI IN EACH OF ITS SEVEN THEMATIC FOCI.
 
 THE REGION CONTEMPLATED BY THE PROJECT ENCOMPASSES NEARLY 8 MILLION HECTARES IN WHICH OVER 50 INDIGENOUS LANDS ARE LOCATED. THE PROJECT WORKS IN SIX MUNICIPALITIES IN THE SOUTH OF AMAZONAS STATE   FIVE IN THE PURUS RIVER BASIN AND ONE IN THE MADEIRA RIVER BASIN   AND BENEFITS SEVEN INDIGENOUS ORGANIZATIONS. THE PROJECT IS ADMINISTERED BY A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION OF BRAZIL (IEB) AND THE NATIVE AMAZONIAN OPERATION. BOTH OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH INDIGENOUS PEOPLES IN THE REGION AND HAVE DEVELOPED LONG-LASTING RELATIONSHIPS AND COMMITMENTS WITH LOCAL INDIGENOUS ORGANIZATIONS.

THE MONITORING AND EVALUATION OF PROJECT ACTIONS ARE TO BE CONDUCTED AT THREE LEVELS: (I) ACTIVITY LEVEL; (II) COMPONENT LEVEL; AND (III) PROJECT LEVEL.
 
 THE WIDESPREAD AND EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF PNGATI IN ITS MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS BY STRENGTHENED INDIGENOUS ORGANIZATIONS, TOGETHER WITH THEIR GOVERNMENTAL AND CIVIL SOCIETY PARTNERS, IS THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THE PROJECT.  FOR ACHIEVING THIS GOAL FOUR KEY RESULTS ARE LISTED BELOW; ONE FOR EACH OF THE PROJECT S FOUR COMPONENTS:
 
 1) A SMALL GRANTS PROGRAM ESTABLISHED AND PROVIDING FINANCIAL AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT TO INDIGENOUS ORGANIZATIONS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PNGATI.
 
 2) INDIGENOUS ORGANIZATIONS STRENGTHENED WITH REQUISITE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS TO SUCCESSFULLY WRITE AND MANAGE PROJECTS THAT IMPLEMENT THE SEVEN THEMATIC FOCI OF PNGATI.

 THE NATIONAL POLICY FOR THE TERRITORIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT OF INDIGENOUS LANDS (PNGATI) OF 2012 IS AN IMPORTANT FRAMEWORK FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF INDIGENOUS LANDS IN BRAZIL. THE MAIN CONSTRAINTS TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PNGATI IN THE SOUTH OF AMAZONAS STATE ARE A LACK OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND TECHNICAL EXPERTISE IN THE WRITING AND ADMINISTRATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND PRODUCTIVE PROJECTS BY INDIGENOUS ORGANIZATIONS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THEIR TERRITORIES.
 
 THIS PROJECT DIRECTLY ADDRESSES THESE CONSTRAINTS IN AN EFFORT TO CATALYZE AN INCIPIENT PROCESS OF TERRITORIAL MANAGEMENT BY LOCAL INDIGENOUS ORGANIZATIONS. BY DESIGNING A SMALL GRANTS PROGRAM THAT ATTENDS TO THE MOST IMMEDIATE MANAGEMENT NEEDS OF INDIGENOUS LANDS IN THE REGION THROUGH THE ACTIVE PARTICIPATION OF LOCAL INDIGENOUS LEADERS, A CRUCIAL INFLUX OF FINANCING FOR SMALL PROJECTS TO ALLOW THESE ORGANIZATIONS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE DIFFICULT PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING PNGATI IN EACH OF ITS SEVEN THEMATIC FOCI.
 
 THE REGION CONTEMPLATED BY THE PROJECT ENCOMPASSES NEARLY 8 MILLION HECTARES IN WHICH OVER 50 INDIGENOUS LANDS ARE LOCATED. THE PROJECT WORKS IN SIX MUNICIPALITIES IN THE SOUTH OF AMAZONAS STATE   FIVE IN THE PURUS RIVER BASIN AND ONE IN THE MADEIRA RIVER BASIN   AND BENEFITS SEVEN INDIGENOUS ORGANIZATIONS. THE PROJECT IS ADMINISTERED BY A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION OF BRAZIL (IEB) AND THE NATIVE AMAZONIAN OPERATION. BOTH OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH INDIGENOUS PEOPLES IN THE REGION AND HAVE DEVELOPED LONG-LASTING RELATIONSHIPS AND COMMITMENTS WITH LOCAL INDIGENOUS ORGANIZATIONS.

THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WILL ATTEND YEARLY MEETINGHS AND TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE OVERALL PLANNING, MONITORING AND EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT. THE MONITORING AND EVALUATION OF PROJECT ACTIONS ARE TO BE CONDUCTED AT THREE LEVELS: (I) ACTIVITY LEVEL; (II) COMPONENT LEVEL; AND (III) PROJECT LEVEL.
 
 THE WIDESPREAD AND EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF PNGATI IN ITS MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS BY STRENGTHENED INDIGENOUS ORGANIZATIONS, TOGETHER WITH THEIR GOVERNMENTAL AND CIVIL SOCIETY PARTNERS, IS THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THE PROJECT.  FOR ACHIEVING THIS GOAL FOUR KEY RESULTS ARE LISTED BELOW; ONE FOR EACH OF THE PROJECT S FOUR COMPONENTS:
 
 1) A SMALL GRANTS PROGRAM ESTABLISHED AND PROVIDING FINANCIAL AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT TO INDIGENOUS ORGANIZATIONS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PNGATI.
 
 2) INDIGENOUS ORGANIZATIONS STRENGTHENED WITH REQUISITE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS TO SUCCESSFULLY WRITE AND MANAGE PROJECTS THAT IMPLEMENT THE SEVEN THEMATIC FOCI OF PNGATI.
 
 3) IMPROVEMENT OF SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION BY INDIGENOUS PEOPLES OF BRAZIL NUTS, OTHER NONTIMBER FOREST PRODUCTS AND PIRARUCU FISH AND FROM AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS FULFILLS GOALS OF TERRITORIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLANS (PGTA).

THE DEFINITION ADOPTED AT UIMQROO BELIEVES THAT INTERCULTURAL EDUCATION, ALLOWS THE TEACHING-LEARNING PROCESS COEXIST WITH DIFFERENT SYSTEMS OF KNOWLEDGE BUILDING, CREATING CONDITIONS FOR INNOVATION AND FOR CREATE NEW KNOWLEDGE AS A RESULT OF THE SYNERGY THAT IS DEVELOPED BETWEEN THE STUDENTS AND FACULTY. THIS PROCESS IS ACCOMPANIED WITH ETHICAL VALUES AND PRINCIPLES THAT INTERACT BETWEEN PEOPLE AND THEIR ENVIRONMENT. THIS PROPOSAL SHOWS HOW INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE EXPERIENCE CAN STRENGTHEN THE INFLUENCE OF CULTURE IN THE PROCESS OF BUILDING KNOWLEDGE, AS LOCAL ETHICAL VALUES THAT THE UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY ADOPTS AND OBSERVES. 
 THESE ARE THE CONCEPTUAL FOUNDATIONS THAT GUIDE THE ACTIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL OFFICE FOR ACADEMIC EXCHANGE PROGRAMS, SOME ELEMENTS DESCRIBING UIMQROO EXPERIENCE, AND SOME OF THE RESULTS THAT ILLUSTRATE THE PROCESS.
 INITIALLY THE MAIN MOTIVATION OF ACADEMIC EXCHANGE PROGRAMS WITH AN INTERCULTURAL APPROACH OF THIS UNIVERSITY WAS THE EXCHANGE OF KNOWLEDGE BETWEEN PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT CULTURES. LATER THIS CONCEPT EVOLVED INCORPORATING SYNERGY AS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN THE INTERACTION PROCESS, WITH A FUNDAMENTAL EMPHASIS IN THE ETHICAL VALUES AND PRINCIPLES RECOGNIZED GLOBALLY AND LOCALLY. IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF KNOWLEDGE AND VALUES, STUDENT MOBILITY EXPERIENCES WERE THE KEY.
 IN THIS EFFORT WE WORK IN COORDINATION WITH ONGS, WITH INDIGENOUS ORGANIZATIONS, GOVERNMENTAL AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS AS CDI (NATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES), THE KELLOGG FOUNDATION, FROM WHOM WE HAVE RECEIVED FUNDING. THROUGH CLASSES, WORKSHOPS, DISCUSSIONS, RESEARCH, COMMUNITY WORK, DISCUSSIONS WITH LOCAL SCHOLARS, SEMINARS WITH ACADEMIC EXPERTS FORMED UNDER THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD, READINGS, AND OTHER ACTIVITIES, WE HAVE STRENGTHENED OUR STUDENTS AND PROFESSORS TO HAVE INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCES.
 FIND, DEVELOP AND FACILITATE ELEMENTS OF THE LOCAL CULTURE, IT IS ONLY PART OF THE PROCESS OF BUILDING KNOWLEDGE, NEED, OF COURSE, FOR THE BETTER UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT CULTURES. HOWEVER, IT IS NECESSARY TO EMPHASIZE ANOTHER ELEMENT RELEVANT, MEANINGFUL, FOR THE PROCESS: AN OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDENTS WITH INDIGENOUS BACKGROUND, IN THIS CASE MAYA, NOT ONLY TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND OTHER LANGUAGES, BUT ALSO THE CULTURE BEHIND THE LANGUAGE AND, ESPECIALLY, THE LOGIC BEHIND THEIR KNOWLEDGE CONSTRUCTION SYSTEM. THIS VIEW IS NOT EASY TO ACHIEVE, NOT WITH LIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES, BUT IT IS DEFINITELY THE BEST WAY TO GO AND PREPARE THEM FOR INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCES.
 ACADEMIC EXCHANGES PROGRAMS NOT ONLY ENABLE OUR STUDENTS TO CONFIRM THEIR OWN LANGUAGE AND CULTURE, IS A WAY TO SHARE THEIR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE. THE OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY ABROAD WILL ALLOW THEM TO BUILD INTERCULTURAL UNDERSTANDING."|UNIVERSIDAD INTERCULTURAL MAYA DE QUINTANA ROO|MEXICO

THE PROGRAM HAS TWO MAJOR COMPONENTS:     
 1. PORTUGUESE CLASSES
 THE CLASSES ARE OFFERED IN THE MONTHS OF JUNE AND JULY, THE PERIOD IN WHICH AMERICAN STUDENTS USUALLY HAVE THEIR VACATIONS AND/OR PLAN THEIR STUDY ABROAD PROGRAMS. THEY ARE HELD FULL-TIME, FROM MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY, 18 HOURS PER WEEK, TOTALING 72 HOURS OF INSTRUCTION PER LEVEL. THE LONG WEEKEND WILL BE USED FOR PLANNED FIELD TRIPS AND CULTURAL VISITS. THE MORNING CLASSES INCLUDE THE TEACHING OF THE FOUR SKILLS (LISTENING, SPEAKING, READING AND WRITING) AND GRAMMAR. THE AFTERNOON CLASSES FOCUS ON BRAZILIAN CULTURE: DISCOVER BRAZIL THROUGH HISTORY AND GEOGRAPHY; BRAZILIAN ECONOMY; CONVERSATION PRACTICE; AND PORTUGUESE THROUGH MUSIC AND FILM.  STUDENTS ALSO HAVE LAB TIME FOR HOMEWORK AND CONVERSATION PARTNERS. WE EXPECT THAT UPON COMPLETION OF THE PROGRAM, STUDENTS WILL HAVE DEVELOPED LINGUISTIC SKILLS IN ORAL AND WRITTEN EXPRESSION, HAVE ACQUIRED A SENSE OF THE CULTURE OF THE PEOPLES WHO SPEAK THE TARGET LANGUAGE, AND DEMONSTRATE AN ABILITY TO READ AND ANALYZE WRITTEN MATERIALS IN THE TARGET LANGUAGE. THEY ARE THEN READY FOR THE SECOND COMPONENT OF THE PROGRAM. 
 2. ACADEMIC SEMESTER
 FAE AND SIENA COLLEGE SIGNED AN AGREEMENT IN 1995, WHICH OFFERS THEIR STUDENTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO OBTAIN ACADEMIC CREDITS BY COMPLETING ONE SEMESTER OR ONE ACADEMIC YEAR IN THE HOST INSTITUTION. SEVERAL STUDY ABROAD PROGRAMS WERE ORGANIZED BY BOTH INSTITUTIONS, BUT, THOUGH WE ARE NOW SUCCESSFUL IN SENDING FAE STUDENTS TO THE UNITED STATES, WE HAVE YET TO SUCCEED IN ESTABLISHING A CYCLE OF RECEIVING STUDENTS HERE AT FAE. SINCE 2011, FAE HAS SENT TWO STUDENTS AS PART OF THE STUDENT MOBILITY OPTION AND FOUR MORE TO COMPLETE THE DUAL DEGREE. THE FIRST DUAL DEGREE RECIPIENT GRADUATES SIMULTANEOUSLY FROM SIENA AND FROM FAE WITH A DEGREE IN ECONOMICS IN DECEMBER 2013. FIVE STUDENTS HAVE BEEN ADMITTED TO SIENA FOR SPRING 2014. ON THE OTHER HAND, FAE HAS ONLY BEEN ABLE TO HOST SIENA STUDENTS THROUGH A CUSTOMIZED SHORT-TERM PROGRAM IN 2011, OF TWO WEEK DURATION, TOTALLY TAUGHT IN ENGLISH. WE UNDERSTAND THAT PROFICIENCY IN PORTUGUESE IS THE BARRIER. BY OFFERING THE STUDENTS THE OPTION TO ATTEND TWO INTENSIVE PORTUGUESE PROGRAMS, WE EXPECT TO ELIMINATE THIS BARRIER AND OFFER SPACE TO 15 STUDENTS INTO OUR REGULAR UNDERGRADUATE CLASSES IN 2014. SIENA STUDENTS ATTENDING REGULAR FAE CLASSES WILL BE ASSIGNED MENTORS TO HELP THEM ORGANIZE THEIR STAYS, AND OFFER LOGISTIC AND ACADEMIC SUPPORT SO THAT THEY CAN COMPLETE THEIR STUDIES SUCCESSFULLY."|ASSOCIACAO FRANCISCANA DE ENSINO SENHOR BOM JESUS|BRAZIL

IN THIS PROJECT, BOTH BRAZILIAN AND AMERICAN STUDENTS WILL WORK SIDE BY SIDE IN BRAZIL, IN TWO DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS: ONE ENTIRELY BRAZILIAN (IFSEMG) AND THE SECOND INTERNATIONAL: (THE IRACAMBI RESEARCH CENTER.) STUDENTS FROM BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE AND WORK TOGETHER ON BOTH CAMPUSES, RECEIVING LANGUAGE AND LOGISTICAL SUPPORT, AND BEING EXPOSED OVER THE COURSE OF THEIR INTERNSHIPS TO ON-THE-GROUND CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES OF RECONCILING ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION WITH SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, WHILE BEING STIMULATED TO WORK TOGETHER TO CREATE APPROPRIATE TECHNICAL RESPONSES AND APPLIED SOLUTIONS.
 WE ENVISION THAT THE STUDENTS WILL WORK TOGETHER AS A TEAM, BOTH AT IFSEMG AND ALSO AT IRACAMBI, TAKING ADVANTAGE OF AN ALL-BRAZILIAN ENVIRONMENT AS WELL AS A BRAZILIAN-BASED INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT. BENEFITS TO THE AMERICAN STUDENTS WILL BE IMMERSION INTO THE BRAZILIAN EXPERIENCE, LANGUAGE AND CULTURE, AND BENEFITS TO BRAZILIAN STUDENTS WILL BE IMMERSION INTO THE INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT AT IRACAMBI. ALL STUDENTS WILL GAIN VALUABLE EXPERIENCE IN WORKING TOGETHER AND ACQUIRING TECHNICAL AND LANGUAGE SKILLS, ALONG WITH A NEW SENSE OF CONFIDENCE AS THEY DISCOVER THEIR COMMON INTERESTS AND FORGE VALUABLE AND POTENTIALLY LASTING FRIENDSHIPS TO STAND THEM IN GOOD STEAD IN THEIR FUTURE CAREERS. THE PROGRAMMATIC CONTRIBUTION FROM TSLI WILL BE IN THE FORM OF SMART COLLABORATION ON AN INNOVATIVE SUSTAINABILITY CURRICULUM, WHEREBY STUDENTS WILL PARTICIPATE IN REGULAR WEB CLASSES DURING THE FIRST SEMESTER, FOLLOWED BY A WEEK S IMMERSION AT IRACAMBI TO INCLUDE PRACTICAL, HAND-ON EXPERIENCE IN CREATING A SUSTAINABLE LIVING ENVIRONMENT. THE IRACAMBI CENTER IS AN IDEAL LOCALE TO INTRODUCE THE SUSTAINABILITY CONCEPTS TO THE STUDENTS, ALLOWING THEM TO RELATE THEIR ACADEMIC EXPERIENCE TO A REAL PROJECT IN A REAL WORLD SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONTEXT. AFTER THIS PRACTICUM, STUDENTS WILL THEN HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION DURING SECOND SEMINAR WEB EXCHANGES.
 ACTIVITIES :
 1. TSCI WILL SHARE WITH THE STUDENTS ITS EXPERTISE IN SUSTAINABLE LIVING, STARTING IN THE FIRST SEMESTER WITH A SERIES OF COLLABORATIVE DISTANCE LEARNING WEBINARS INTRODUCING THE CONCEPTS OF SUSTAINABILITY. THESE WILL BE REINFORCED IN MID-YEAR BY A WEEK LONG COURSE AT IRACAMBI FOR FACULTY AND STUDENTS, AND DISTANCE LEARNING WILL CONTINUE DURING THE SECOND SEMESTER. THIS TYPE OF SMART COLLABORATION WILL BE A NOVELTY TO BOTH BRAZILIAN ORGANIZATIONS, WHICH EXPECT TO BENEFIT ENORMOUSLY FROM THE EXPERIENCE.
 2. MONTHLY INTERCHANGES OF IFSEMG AND IRACAMBI STUDENTS. IRACAMBI STUDENTS FROM THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE WILL SPEND THE FIRST WEEK OF EACH MONTH FINDING THEIR FEET AT IRACAMBI, WHERE THEY WILL BE JOINED IN THE SECOND WEEK BY BRAZILIAN STUDENTS FROM IFSEMG. DURING THE THIRD WEEK THE COMBINED TEAM OF STUDENTS WILL CONTINUE THEIR STUDIES AT IFSEMG, AND DURING THE FOURTH WEEK EACH GROUP WILL RETURN TO ITS OWN CAMPUS TO REFLECT ON WHAT THEY HAVE LEARNED AND PREPARE FOR THEIR NEXT ENCOUNTER. WE ENVISION A ROBUST EXCHANGE OF CONTACTS AND COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN NEW COLLEAGUES THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS, THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA AND EMAIL.
 3. MANAGEMENT SUPPORT FOR THIS PROGRAM WILL CONSIST OF CLOSE COLLABORATION BETWEEN ALL THREE INSTITUTIONS, UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE ADVISOR ON INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AT IFSEMG, DR WAGNER BELO. FUNDING WILL INCLUDE AN HONORARIUM FOR THE TECHNICAL
 SUPERVISOR AT IRACAMBI WHO WILL COORDINATE THE INTERNSHIPS, AS WELL AS FOLLOWING UP ON LEADS ALREADY IN PLACE TO SEEK CORPORATE FUNDING TO ENSURE THE LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF THE PROGRAM."|INSTITUTO FEDERAL DE EDUCACAO, CIENCIA E TECNOLOGIA DO SUDESTE DE MINAS GERAIS.|BRAZIL

A RECENT SYSTEMATIC REVIEW IDENTIFIED A HIGH PREVALENCE OF LIFETIME PHYSICAL (68%) OR SEXUAL VIOLENCE (49%) AMONG TGW. FREQUENT EXPERIENCES OF VIOLENCE CONTRIBUTES TO HIGH LEVELS OF POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD), GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER (GAD), SUICIDALITY, SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER (SUD) AND MIGHT INFLUENCE THE ONSET, PROGRESSION, AND PROGNOSIS OF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (MDD) AMONG TGW. SINCE 2008 BRAZIL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE THAN 40% OF ALL TRANSGENDER HOMICIDES REPORTED WORLDWIDE. IN 2016/17 WE CONDUCTED A SURVEY WITH 2,846 TGW FROM TWELVE BRAZILIAN CITIES, IDENTIFYING 60% PREVALENCE OF LIFETIME VIOLENCE (PHYSICAL AND/OR SEXUAL), 60% OF PARTICIPANTS SCREENED POSITIVE FOR MDD, 38% FOR GAD, AND 35% ATTEMPTED SUICIDE. THE MAJORITY OF VIOLENT INCIDENTS WERE NOT REPORTED TO THE POLICE (91%) AND MOST VICTIMS DID NOT RECEIVE ANY COUNSELING OR MENTAL HEALTH (MH) TREATMENT (82%). ON THIS RESUBMISSION, WE WILL UTILIZE COMMUNITY-BASED PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH (CBPR) TO ADAPT THE “UNI-FORM” APP AND ONLINE PLATFORM (HTTPS://UNI-FORM.EU) TO TGW FROM BRAZIL. THE STUDY SPECIFIC AIMS ARE: (1) REFINE AND ADAPT THE “UNI-FORM” MHEALTH INTERVENTION TO BRAZIL (RISE), INCLUDING MH SCREENING AND LINK TO MH CARE; (2) PILOT TEST RISE TO PREVENT VIOLENCE, IMPROVE MH SCREENING AND TREATMENT; AND (3) EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF RISE. THIS R21 EXPLORATORY PROJECT PROPOSES TO RECRUIT 200 TGW FROM RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL TO STUDY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF RISE. CONSISTENT WITH NIMH GOAL TO ENHANCE RESEARCH CAPACITY, THE PROPOSAL IS LED BY AN EARLY STAGE INVESTIGATOR AND INCLUDES A CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH RESEARCHERS FROM DUKE WHO WILL PROVIDE CONSTANT SUPERVISION FROM RESEARCHERS WITH SENIOR EXPERTISE IN SGM MHEALTH (DR. LEGRAND), SGM MH INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH (DR. WHETTEN), MH AND IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE (DR. BELDEN). THIS PROPOSAL IS INNOVATIVE IN SEVERAL WAYS: IT WILL ADAPT TO BRAZIL AN EXISTING MHEALTH INTERVENTION ADDRESSING SGM-RELATED VIOLENCE (UNI-FORM), TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FEATURES TO INCREASE MH SCREENING AND LINKAGE TO MH CARE. THE PROPOSED APP, RISE, HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE CRISES RESPONSE AND PROMOTE TIMELY MH CARE AMONG A HIGH-RISK POPULATION: TGW. IT HAS SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT: THE INTERVENTION WILL PREVENT AND RESPOND TO VIOLENCE AGAINST TGW, IN A COUNTRY WITH THE HIGHEST RATE OF TRANSGENDER MURDERS IN THE WORLD. IT WILL ALSO DEVELOP AN INNOVATIVE STRATEGY TO IDENTIFY AND LINK TO CARE TGW WHO NEED MH CARE, A POPULATION WITH HIGH PREVALENCE OF PTSD, GAD, MDD, SUD AND SUICIDALITY. THOSE MENTAL DISORDERS ARE UNDERSCREENED, UNDERDIAGNOSED, AND UNDERTREATED AMONG TGW. IF SUCCESSFUL, THE INTERVENTION COULD BE SCALED UP AND ADAPTED TO OTHER POPULATIONS AND COUNTRIES. THIS RESEARCH WILL YIELD THE CRUCIAL FIRST STEPS IN DEVELOPING A LOWER COST AND EFFICACIOUS MHEALTH INTERVENTION THAT WE PLAN TO EVALUATE WITH AN RCT IN A SUBSEQUENT R01.

FREQUENT EXPERIENCES OF VIOLENCE CONTRIBUTES TO HIGH LEVELS OF POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD), GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER (GAD), SUICIDALITY, SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER (SUD) AND MIGHT INFLUENCE THE ONSET, PROGRESSION, AND PROGNOSIS OF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (MDD) AMONG TGW. SINCE 2008 BRAZIL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE THAN 40% OF ALL TRANSGENDER HOMICIDES REPORTED WORLDWIDE. IN 2016/17 WE CONDUCTED A SURVEY WITH 2,846 TGW FROM TWELVE BRAZILIAN CITIES, IDENTIFYING 60% PREVALENCE OF LIFETIME VIOLENCE (PHYSICAL AND/OR SEXUAL), 60% OF PARTICIPANTS SCREENED POSITIVE FOR MDD, 38% FOR GAD, AND 35% ATTEMPTED SUICIDE. THE MAJORITY OF VIOLENT INCIDENTS WERE NOT REPORTED TO THE POLICE (91%) AND MOST VICTIMS DID NOT RECEIVE ANY COUNSELING OR MENTAL HEALTH (MH) TREATMENT (82%). ON THIS RESUBMISSION, WE WILL UTILIZE COMMUNITY-BASED PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH (CBPR) TO ADAPT THE “UNI-FORM” APP AND ONLINE PLATFORM (HTTPS://UNI-FORM.EU) TO TGW FROM BRAZIL. THE STUDY SPECIFIC AIMS ARE: (1) REFINE AND ADAPT THE “UNI-FORM” MHEALTH INTERVENTION TO BRAZIL (RISE), INCLUDING MH SCREENING AND LINK TO MH CARE; (2) PILOT TEST RISE TO PREVENT VIOLENCE, IMPROVE MH SCREENING AND TREATMENT; AND (3) EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF RISE. THIS R21 EXPLORATORY PROJECT PROPOSES TO RECRUIT 200 TGW FROM RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL TO STUDY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF RISE. CONSISTENT WITH NIMH GOAL TO ENHANCE RESEARCH CAPACITY, THE PROPOSAL IS LED BY AN EARLY STAGE INVESTIGATOR AND INCLUDES A CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH RESEARCHERS FROM DUKE WHO WILL PROVIDE CONSTANT SUPERVISION FROM RESEARCHERS WITH SENIOR EXPERTISE IN SGM MHEALTH (DR. LEGRAND), SGM MH INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH (DR. WHETTEN), MH AND IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE (DR. BELDEN). THIS PROPOSAL IS INNOVATIVE IN SEVERAL WAYS: IT WILL ADAPT TO BRAZIL AN EXISTING MHEALTH INTERVENTION ADDRESSING SGM-RELATED VIOLENCE (UNI-FORM), TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FEATURES TO INCREASE MH SCREENING AND LINKAGE TO MH CARE. THE PROPOSED APP, RISE, HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE CRISES RESPONSE AND PROMOTE TIMELY MH CARE AMONG A HIGH-RISK POPULATION: TGW. IT HAS SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT: THE INTERVENTION WILL PREVENT AND RESPOND TO VIOLENCE AGAINST TGW, IN A COUNTRY WITH THE HIGHEST RATE OF TRANSGENDER MURDERS IN THE WORLD. IT WILL ALSO DEVELOP AN INNOVATIVE STRATEGY TO IDENTIFY AND LINK TO CARE TGW WHO NEED MH CARE, A POPULATION WITH HIGH PREVALENCE OF PTSD, GAD, MDD, SUD AND SUICIDALITY. THOSE MENTAL DISORDERS ARE UNDERSCREENED, UNDERDIAGNOSED, AND UNDERTREATED AMONG TGW. IF SUCCESSFUL, THE INTERVENTION COULD BE SCALED UP AND ADAPTED TO OTHER POPULATIONS AND COUNTRIES. THIS RESEARCH WILL YIELD THE CRUCIAL FIRST STEPS IN DEVELOPING A LOWER COST AND EFFICACIOUS MHEALTH INTERVENTION THAT WE PLAN TO EVALUATE WITH AN RCT IN A SUBSEQUENT R01.

CONSISTENT WITH NIMH GOAL TO ENHANCE RESEARCH CAPACITY, THE PROPOSAL IS LED BY AN EARLY STAGE INVESTIGATOR AND INCLUDES A CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH RESEARCHERS FROM DUKE WHO WILL PROVIDE CONSTANT SUPERVISION FROM RESEARCHERS WITH SENIOR EXPERTISE IN SGM MHEALTH (DR. LEGRAND), SGM MH INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH (DR. WHETTEN), MH AND IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE (DR. BELDEN). THIS PROPOSAL IS INNOVATIVE IN SEVERAL WAYS: IT WILL ADAPT TO BRAZIL AN EXISTING MHEALTH INTERVENTION ADDRESSING SGM-RELATED VIOLENCE (UNI-FORM), TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FEATURES TO INCREASE MH SCREENING AND LINKAGE TO MH CARE. THE PROPOSED APP, RISE, HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE CRISES RESPONSE AND PROMOTE TIMELY MH CARE AMONG A HIGH-RISK POPULATION: TGW. IT HAS SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT: THE INTERVENTION WILL PREVENT AND RESPOND TO VIOLENCE AGAINST TGW, IN A COUNTRY WITH THE HIGHEST RATE OF TRANSGENDER MURDERS IN THE WORLD. IT WILL ALSO DEVELOP AN INNOVATIVE STRATEGY TO IDENTIFY AND LINK TO CARE TGW WHO NEED MH CARE, A POPULATION WITH HIGH PREVALENCE OF PTSD, GAD, MDD, SUD AND SUICIDALITY. THOSE MENTAL DISORDERS ARE UNDERSCREENED, UNDERDIAGNOSED, AND UNDERTREATED AMONG TGW. IF SUCCESSFUL, THE INTERVENTION COULD BE SCALED UP AND ADAPTED TO OTHER POPULATIONS AND COUNTRIES. THIS RESEARCH WILL YIELD THE CRUCIAL FIRST STEPS IN DEVELOPING A LOWER COST AND EFFICACIOUS MHEALTH INTERVENTION THAT WE PLAN TO EVALUATE WITH AN RCT IN A SUBSEQUENT R01. RISE ADDRESSES ALL THREE NIMH PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED IN THE NOTICE OF SPECIAL INTEREST IN RESEARCH ON HEALTH OF SGM POPULATIONS (NOT-MD-19-001), GRAND CHALLENGES IN GLOBAL MENTAL HEALTH AND NIMH STRATEGIC AIM 3."|"RISE STUDY (""RESIST, INTERVENE, SUPPORT, EMPOWER""): FEASIBILITY/ACCEPTABILITY OF MHEALTH INTERVENTION TARGETING TRANSGENDER WOMEN FACING GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE AND MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS IN BRAZIL - TRANSGENDER WOMEN (TGW) DISPROPORTIONATELY EXPERIENCE PHYSICAL/SEXUAL VIOLENCE WHEN COMPARED WITH THE GENERAL POPULATION AND WITH OTHER SEXUAL AND GENDER MINORITIES (SGMS). A RECENT SYSTEMATIC REVIEW IDENTIFIED A HIGH PREVALENCE OF LIFETIME PHYSICAL (68%) OR SEXUAL VIOLENCE (49%) AMONG TGW. FREQUENT EXPERIENCES OF VIOLENCE CONTRIBUTES TO HIGH LEVELS OF POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD), GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER (GAD), SUICIDALITY, SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER (SUD) AND MIGHT INFLUENCE THE ONSET, PROGRESSION, AND PROGNOSIS OF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (MDD) AMONG TGW. SINCE 2008 BRAZIL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE THAN 40% OF ALL TRANSGENDER HOMICIDES REPORTED WORLDWIDE. IN 2016/17 WE CONDUCTED A SURVEY WITH 2,846 TGW FROM TWELVE BRAZILIAN CITIES, IDENTIFYING 60% PREVALENCE OF LIFETIME VIOLENCE (PHYSICAL AND/OR SEXUAL), 60% OF PARTICIPANTS SCREENED POSITIVE FOR MDD, 38% FOR GAD, AND 35% ATTEMPTED SUICIDE. THE MAJORITY OF VIOLENT INCIDENTS WERE NOT REPORTED TO THE POLICE (91%) AND MOST VICTIMS DID NOT RECEIVE ANY COUNSELING OR MENTAL HEALTH (MH) TREATMENT (82%). ON THIS RESUBMISSION, WE WILL UTILIZE COMMUNITY-BASED PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH (CBPR) TO ADAPT THE “UNI-FORM” APP AND ONLINE PLATFORM (HTTPS://UNI-FORM.EU) TO TGW FROM BRAZIL.

THIS INFORMATION WILL BE USED TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT HABITAT MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES THAT WILL MAXIMIZE THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF HABITAT AVAILABLE FOR SHOREBIRDS. PREVIOUS RESEARCH AT THE SITE HAS PROVIDED BASELINE INFORMATION ABOUT MOVEMENT AND HABITAT USE FOR A GENERALIST SPECIES, THE SEMIPALMATED SANDPIPER (CALIDRIS PUSILLA), BUT LESS IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW SPECIALIST SPECIES LIKE RED KNOT (CALIDRIS CANUTUS RUFA) AND SHORT-BILLED DOWITCHER (LIMNODROMUS GRISEUS GRISEUS) USE THE SITE. PREVIOUS SURVEYS HAVE DOCUMENTED SIZABLE PORTIONS OF THE GLOBAL POPULATION OF RED KNOT AND SHORT-BILLED DOWITCHER UTILIZING THE BANCO DOS CAJUAIS DURING THE NON-BREEDING PERIOD, THUS THIS SITE PROVIDES CRITICAL HABITAT CONTRIBUTING TO THE LONG-TERM CONSERVATION EFFORTS OF THESE MIGRATORY SPECIES. OUR OBJECTIVES INCLUDE (1) ASSESSING LOCAL MOVEMENTS BETWEEN KEY HABITATS USED BY RED KNOT, SHORT-BILLED DOWITCHER, RUDDY TURNSTONE (ARENARIA INTERPRES), AND SEMIPALMATED SANDPIPER AT THE BANCO DOS CAJUAIS. THESE FOUR SHOREBIRD SPECIES ARE OF HIGH CONSERVATION CONCERN AND ARE LISTED ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY (ROAD TO RECOVERY 2022). USING THE MOTUS WILDLIFE TRACKING SYSTEM, WE WILL BE ABLE TO TRACK THE LOCAL MOVEMENTS OF THESE SHOREBIRDS AND QUANTIFY THE AMOUNT OF TIME SPENT IN THE AVAILABLE HABITATS AT THE SITE. WE WILL ALSO (2) TRACK THE NORTHBOUND MIGRATION OF SHOREBIRD SPECIES OF HIGH CONSERVATION CONCERN AT THE BANCO DOS CAJUAIS USING SOLAR-POWERED SATELLITE TRANSMITTERS, TARGETING RED KNOT, SHORT-BILLED DOWITCHER, AND RUDDY TURNSTONE. THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY WILL ALLOW US TO DISCERN MIGRATORY PATHWAYS TO INFORM OFFSHORE WIND TURBINE PLACEMENT TO MINIMIZE RISKS TO AT RISK SHOREBIRD SPECIES. WE WILL ALSO USE THESE DATA TO IDENTIFY STAGING AREAS FOR NORTHBOUND MIGRATION, AND ASSESS CONNECTIVITY FROM THE BANCO DOS CAJUAIS, ALL OF WHICH IS LARGELY UNKNOWN AND CRITICAL TO CONSERVING THESE SPECIES. WE EXPECT TO PRODUCE MULTIPLE PUBLICATIONS OUTLINING THE RESULTS OF OUR RESEARCH. WE WILL ALSO USE THE RESULTS OF THIS WORK TO INFORM CONSERVATION ACTIVITIES AT THIS REGIONALLY IMPORTANT SITE.

FINALLY, OUR RESULTS WILL BE INTEGRATED WITH THE EXISTING COMMUNITY OUTREACH EFFORTS OF AQUASIS IN ICAPU, THE MUNICIPALITY WHERE THE BANCO DOS CAJUAIS IS LOCATED. SHOREBIRDS HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED AS PART OF THE NATURAL HERITAGE OF THE MUNICIPALITY AND HAVE BECOME AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE LOCAL CULTURE AND ECONOMY. PREVIOUS OUTREACH EFFORTS IN THE REGION HAVE RESULTED IN STRONG PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT, BUSINESSES, AND SCHOOLS TO ENSURE THE COMMUNITY IS DIRECTLY INVOLVED WITH THE CONSERVATION OF THESE SPECIES.

MASDEN (2015) OUTLINED THIS MODEL, WHICH INCLUDE A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AND INADEQUATE CONSIDERATION OF UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES. TO THIS END, THE BAND (2012) MODEL WAS UPDATED TO BETTER ACCOUNT FOR UNCERTAINTY AND MIGRATED TO TRANSPARENT SCRIPTS IN THE R PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE. THIS WAS FURTHER ADAPTED AND ENHANCED TO AN R LANGUAGE STATISTICAL PACKAGE (STOCHLAB), WHICH HAS BECOME THE RECOMMENDED METHOD FOR COLLISION RISK MODELLING IN THE UK SECTOR. RECENTLY, U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE (FWS) AND THE BIODIVERSITY RESEARCH INSTITUTE (BRI) CREATED A NEW COLLISION RISK MODEL, STOCHASTIC COLLISION RISK ASSESSMENT FOR MOVEMENT (SCRAM), TO BETTER INFORM OFFSHORE WIND ASSESSMENTS IN THE US BASED ON THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE. THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO ENHANCE THE COLLISION RISK MODELING PROCEDURE TO FACILITATE EFFECTS STUDIES FOR THE THREE LISTED SPECIES IN THE ATLANTIC REGION OF THE UNITED STATES: THE RED KNOT, PIPING PLOVER, AND ROSEATE TERN. THIS WAS ACHIEVED VIA THREE METHODS: I) ENHANCING THE MODELS TRANSPARENCY REGARDING COLLISION RISK  II) STARTING TO CONSIDER THE CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF BEING EXPOSED TO SEVERAL OFFSHORE WIND LEASES  AND III) APPROPRIATELY ACCOUNTING FOR VARIOUS SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTY, SUCH AS STOCHASTICITY, PARAMETRIC VARIABILITY, AND MODEL UNCERTAINTY. THESE IMPROVEMENTS HAVE ALLOWED FOR THIS NEW TOOL SET TO BE APPLIED BY BOEM FOR CASE STUDIES. HOWEVER, FURTHER WORK IS REQUIRED TO ENSURE THAT THESE APPROACHES ARE ALIGNED WITH INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED BEST PRACTICE, ARE BASED ON THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE AND DATA, AND ARE CAPABLE OF FEEDING INTO CUMULATIVE IMPACT ASSESSMENTS THAT FULLY CAPTURE ALL PROJECTS SPECIES MAY ENCOUNTER AS PART OF THEIR ANNUAL CYCLES. THIS PROPOSAL WILL SUPPORT COLLABORATION BETWEEN BRI, FWS AND DR AONGHAIS COOK, PRINCIPAL CONSULTANT AT THE BIODIVERSITY CONSULTANCY, AN INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED EXPERT ON COLLISION RISK MODELING. DRAWING FROM HIS EXPERIENCE OF APPLYING COLLISION RISK MODELS IN THE UK, EUROPE AND AUSTRALIA, DR COOK WILL REVIEW THE THEORETICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF THE SCRAM MODEL, AND WILL PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THE ASSOCIATED SENSITIVITY ANALYSES. RECOGNIZING THAT THIS IS A RAPIDLY EVOLVING FIELD, WITH SIGNIFICANT POLICY IMPLICATIONS, DR COOK WILL SUPPORT FWS AND BRI IN DEVELOPING A PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT NEW EVIDENCE AND DATA, FOR EXAMPLE DENSITY DATA FROM DIGITAL AERIAL SURVEYS, CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO THE REGULATORY PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITHIN COLLISION RISK MODELING IN A TIMELY FASHION. AT PRESENT, COLLISION RISK MAY ONLY BE CONSIDERED IN RELATION TO A SMALL PART OF THE SPECIES ANNUAL RANGE, POTENTIALLY RESULTING IN AN UNDERESTIMATE OF THE RISK POSED TO THE POPULATION BY OFFSHORE WIND FARMS. IN ADDITION TO PROJECTS PLANNED ON THE US EAST COAST, MULTIPLE PROJECTS ARE PLANNED IN COUNTRIES INCLUDING COLOMBIA AND BRAZIL. THIS PRESENTS MANY CHALLENGES, PARTICULARLY IN RELATION TO THE AVAILABILITY OF DATA IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS.

MEN OF AFRICAN ANCESTRY AND/OR FROM AFRICA ARE AT GREATEST RISK FOR AGGRESSIVE DISEASE. COMPARED TO NON-AFRICANS, AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN ARE AT 2.5 TO 5-FOLD INCREASED RISK FOR LETHALITY. HERE WE WILL ADDRESS IF THIS GEO-ETHNIC DISPARITY IS DRIVEN BY ETHNICITY (GENETICS), GEOGRAPHY (ENVIRONMENT), OR A COMBINATION. OUR APPROACH IS TO USE THE POWER OF WHOLE TUMOR/BLOOD GENOME INTERROGATION TO IDENTIFY CONTRIBUTING GENETIC AND NON-GENETIC FACTORS. GENETIC FACTORS INCLUDE FROM INHERITED RARE PATHOGENIC MUTATIONS TO TISSUE ACQUIRED CANCER DRIVERS.

THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE INDIVIDUALS EXPOSED TO M. LEPRAE BECOMES INFECTED, BUT ONLY A SMALL PROPORTION OF THE INFECTED INDIVIDUALS EVOLVES TO ACTIVE DISEASE. PREVIOUS WORK IN LEPROSY AND TUBERCULOSIS DEMONSTRATED A MAJOR ROLE OF INTERFERON-Γ, AN EFFECTOR CYTOKINE PRODUCED BY PATHOGEN-SPECIFIC MEMORY CD4 T CELLS, IN THE CONTROL OF THE INFECTION BY THESE INTRACELLULAR PATHOGENS. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA SHOW A PROGRESSIVE REDUCTION IN M. LEPRAE-SPECIFIC IFNΓ LEVELS IN INDIVIDUALS THAT CORRELATES TO INDICATORS OF LEVEL OF EXPOSURE TO M. LEPRAE AND TO BACILLARY LOAD IN INDIVIDUALS WITH LEPROSY. WHEN WE EVALUATED THE INTERACTION OF M. LEPRAE WITH SCHWANN CELLS AND MONONUCLEAR PHAGOCYTES, WE OBSERVED AN INDUCTION OF THE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINE IL-10 AND THE LIPID MEDIATOR PGE-2. METABOLOMICS ANALYSES OF LESIONS AND SERA FROM LEPROSY PATIENTS ALSO DEMONSTRATED CLEAR DIFFERENCES IN THE PRESENCE OF POLYUNSATURATED FATTY ACID (PUFA) DERIVED LIPID MEDIATORS THAT CORRELATED TO THE CLINICAL FORMS OF LEPROSY AND BACILLARY LOADS. OTHER INVESTIGATORS DETECTED FREQUENCIES OF FOXP-3 POSITIVE T CELLS IN THE BLOOD AND LESIONS OF LEPROSY PATIENTS THAT CORRELATE TO THE EXPECTED INHIBITION OF CELLULAR IMMUNITY AND EFFECTOR FUNCTION AGAINST M. LEPRAE IN THE MULTIBACILLARY FORMS OF LEPROSY. TAKING IN TO ACCOUNT THESE FINDINGS, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT M.

BUT CHALLENGES REMAIN IN TERMS OF SCALING UP SUCCESSFUL NATIONAL PROGRAMS. THIS STUDY WILL CONTRIBUTE TO KNOWLEDGE ON THE IMPACT OF LARGE-SCALE INITIATIVES ADDRESSING BOTH THE SOCIAL AND MEDICAL DETERMINANTS OF HIV/AIDS BY COMBINING DATA FROM BRAZIL’S NATIONAL HIV/AIDS REGISTRY WITH OTHER LARGESCALE DATABASES INCLUDING THE “100 MILLION BRAZILIAN COHORT”: A VIRTUAL COHORT OF MORE THAN 100 MILLION INDIVIDUALS OVER 18 YEARS OBTAINED BY THE LINKAGE OF LARGE COUNTRYWIDE SOCIOECONOMIC AND HEALTH DATASETS. IT WILL BE THE FIRST STUDY TO FOLLOW SUCH A LARGE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS OVER TIME AND IN NON-EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS TO UNDERSTAND HOW SOCIAL DETERMINANTS, CONDITIONAL CASH TRANSFERS AND PRIMARY HEALTH CARE AFFECT HIV/AIDS INCIDENCE, HOSPITALIZATION AND MORTALITY; AND HOW RECEIPT OF SOCIAL PROTECTIONS AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL AFFECTS HIV/AIDS OUTCOMES (ART ADHERENCE AND MORTALITY). THANKS TO THE UNPRECEDENTED DIMENSION OF THE DATASET AND THE METHODS PROPOSED, WE WILL ASSESS IMPACT HETEROGENEITIES OF THE TWO INTERVENTIONS IN A LARGE RANGE OF DIFFERENT SUBPOPULATIONS, AS WELL AS POSSIBLE SYNERGISTIC EFFECTS.

IT WILL BE THE FIRST STUDY TO FOLLOW SUCH A LARGE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS OVER TIME AND IN NON-EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS TO UNDERSTAND HOW SOCIAL DETERMINANTS, CONDITIONAL CASH TRANSFERS AND PRIMARY HEALTH CARE AFFECT HIV/AIDS INCIDENCE, HOSPITALIZATION AND MORTALITY; AND HOW RECEIPT OF SOCIAL PROTECTIONS AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL AFFECTS HIV/AIDS OUTCOMES (ART ADHERENCE AND MORTALITY). THANKS TO THE UNPRECEDENTED DIMENSION OF THE DATASET AND THE METHODS PROPOSED, WE WILL ASSESS IMPACT HETEROGENEITIES OF THE TWO INTERVENTIONS IN A LARGE RANGE OF DIFFERENT SUBPOPULATIONS, AS WELL AS POSSIBLE SYNERGISTIC EFFECTS. USING THE LONGITUDINAL ASPECT OF THE COHORT WE WILL EXPLORE AND ASSESS IN DEPTH EXPECTED AND UNEXPECTED DYNAMICS, LAGGED AND LONG- TERM EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN LIVING CONDITIONS AND IN EXPOSURES TO CONDITIONAL CASH TRANSFERS AND COMMUNITY- BASED PRIMARY HEALTH CARE. WE WILL THEN EXPAND THE COHORT AND INTEGRATE ESTIMATES FROM THE RETROSPECTIVE EVALUATIONS WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF FORECASTING FOR SEVERAL ALTERNATIVE POLICY SCENARIOS. USING AN INNOVATIVE JOINED MICROSIMULATION AND AGENT-BASED MODEL WE WILL BE ABLE TO FORECAST THE EFFECTS OF THE CURRENT BRAZILIAN ECONOMIC CRISIS, OVERALL AND FOR SEVERAL SUBPOPULATIONS, ON THE HIV/AIDS EPIDEMIC. WE WILL FORECAST AND COMPARE THE IMPACT OF A WIDE RANGE OF ALTERNATIVE POLICY SCENARIOS, SUCH AS THE MAINTENANCE OF CURRENT LEVELS OF SUPPORT OF CONDITIONAL CASH TRANSFER AND PRIMARY CARE, REDUCTIONS OF COVERAGE AND BENEFITS DUE TO FISCAL AUSTERITY MEASURES, OR EXPANSION IN DIFFERENT SUBPOPULATION AND WITH DIFFERENT DYNAMICS. WE WILL CALIBRATE AND SELECT THE COMBINATIONS OF POLICY RESPONSE ABLE TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS ON THE HIV/AIDS EPIDEMIC, EVEN DURING AN ECONOMIC CRISIS. THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS AND THE INNOVATIVE MATHEMATICAL MODELS PRODUCED IN THIS PROJECT WILL REPRESENT AN ESSENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE UNDERSTANDING AND CONTROL OF HIV/AIDS IN LOWER AND MIDDLE INCOME COUNTRY SETTINGS, AS WELL AS FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES.|2024-03-29|Department of Health and Human Services|National Institutes of Health|FUNDACAO DE APOIO A PESQUISA E A EXTENSAO||BRAZIL|BRAZIL|||||||

SUMMARY FUNGAL DISEASES ARE A MAJOR THREAT TO IMMUNOCOMPROMISED PATIENTS. CRYPTOCOCCOSIS, CAUSED BY MEMBERS OF THE CRYPTOCOCCUS GENUS, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR NEARLY 200,000 DEATHS WORLDWIDE ANNUALLY. IMMUNOCOMPROMISED INDIVIDUALS ARE THE PRIMARY POPULATION THAT DEVELOP CRYPTOCOCCAL MENINGOENCEPHALITIS, A 100% FATAL CONDITION IF LEFT UNTREATED. C. NEOFORMANS, THE MOST COMMON CAUSATIVE AGENT OF CRYPTOCOCCOSIS, HAS RECENTLY BEEN CLASSIFIED AS A CRITICAL THREAT BY THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION. DESPITE THEIR DEVASTATING IMPACT ON HUMAN HEALTH, FUNGAL DISEASES HAVE BEEN CONSISTENTLY NEGLECTED, AS DEMONSTRATED BY THE LACK OF AVAILABLE ANTIFUNGAL VACCINES AND OUR LIMITED ANTIFUNGAL ARMAMENTARIUM. THE RODRIGUES AND NOSANCHUK LABORATORIES HAVE COLLABORATED ACTIVELY FOR OVER 15 YEARS IN THE FIELD OF FUNGAL INFECTIONS AND HAVE EXTENSIVELY CHARACTERIZED FUNGAL EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES (EVS) IN VARIOUS MODELS. EVS PLAY CRUCIAL ROLES IN FUNGAL PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS. RECENTLY, WE DISCOVERED THAT THE TRIPEPTIDE ISOLEUCINE-PROLINE-ISOLEUCINE (IPI), A SMALL MOLECULE COMPONENT OF EVS, EFFECTIVELY CONTROLS CRYPTOCOCCAL INFECTION IN AN INVERTEBRATE HOST. IPI ACTS AS AN INHIBITOR OF DIPEPTIDYL PEPTIDASE 4 (DPP4), WHICH PLAYS A ROLE IN FUNGAL PATHOGENESIS, AS WELL AS IN HOST PHYSIOLOGY, BY REGULATING INSULIN AND GLUCOSE. IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE AIM TO INVESTIGATE THE PARTICIPATION OF IPI AND DPP4 IN FUNGAL IMMUNOPATHOGENESIS THROUGH THREE SPECIFIC AIMS. AIM 1 WILL EXPLORE THE PROTECTIVE MECHANISMS OF IPI IN ANIMAL MODELS OF CRYPTOCOCCOSIS. AIM 2 FOCUSES ON UNDERSTANDING THE ROLES OF FUNGAL AND HOST DPP4 IN DISEASE PROGRESSION, INCLUDING THEIR IMPACT ON GLUCOSE METABOLISM AND THE IMMUNE RESPONSE. AIM 3 SEEKS TO DETERMINE THE RELEVANCE OF IPI AND DPP4 IN OTHER FUNGAL MODELS. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE CHARACTERIZATION OF A NOVEL CANDIDATE FOR COMBATING CRYPTOCOCCOSIS AND PERHAPS OTHER DISEASES. FURTHERMORE, WE ANTICIPATE GAINING INSIGHTS INTO THE CONNECTION BETWEEN DPP4 AND FUNGAL PATHOGENESIS.

TWO VACCINES ARE IN EARLY STAGE CLINICAL TRIALS AND BOTH TARGET DOMAINS WITHIN THE PROTEIN VAR2CSA, WHICH IS THE MAJOR SURFACE ANTIGEN EXPRESSED BY PLASMODIUM FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL ISOLATES. THIS PROTEIN BINDS TO RECEPTORS IN THE PLACENTA AND MEDIATES SEQUESTRATION OF INFECTED RED BLOOD CELLS (IRBCS), UNDERPINNING THE PATHOGENESIS OF PLACENTAL MALARIA. HOWEVER, VAR2CSA IS UNDER STRONG IMMUNE SELECTION AND IS HIGHLY POLYMORPHIC; THIS COMPROMISES VACCINE EFFICACY BY LIMITING THE BREADTH OF PROTECTION AGAINST DIVERSE ALLELES. POLYMORPHIC ANTIGENS PRESENT A UBIQUITOUS CHALLENGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MALARIA SUBUNIT VACCINES. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO A VACCINE AGAINST PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED MALARIA THAT TARGETS HIGHLY CONSERVED, SUBDOMINANT (EVEN CRYPTIC) EPITOPES. WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT THIS APPROACH IS THAT IT EXPLOITS A MECHANISM OF CROSS- SPECIES IMMUNITY, WHERE EPITOPES FROM ONE PLASMODIUM SPECIES ELICIT ROBUST, BROADLY NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES AGAINST STRUCTURALLY RELATED ANTIGENS FROM ANOTHER SPECIES. THIS MECHANISM WAS DISCOVERED RECENTLY IN COLOMBIAN AND BRAZILIAN POPULATIONS WHERE VAR2CSA ANTIBODIES CAN BE ACQUIRED OUTSIDE OF PREGNANCY FOLLOWING INFECTION WITH P. VIVAX, AND THESE ANTIBODIES BLOCKED SEQUESTRATION OF IRBCS USING IN VITRO CORRELATES OF PLACENTAL MALARIA. THE CROSS-REACTIVE EPITOPE IN P. VIVAX WAS MAPPED TO SUBDOMAIN (SD1) IN PVDBP AND HUMAN SD1-PURIFIED ANTIBODIES BLOCKED PARASITE ADHESION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A VACCINE TO PROTECT PREGNANT WOMEN FROM FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL MALARIA THAT IS BASED ON THE CROSS- REACTIVE EPITOPE IN VIVAX SD1. THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH SYNTHESIS OF THREE COMPLEMENTARY SPECIFIC AIMS. EPITOPES REQUIRED TO ELICIT FUNCTIONAL, CROSS-REACTIVE ANTIBODIES WILL BE IDENTIFIED IN AIM 1 THROUGH CONFORMATIONALLY CONSTRICTED PEPTIDE MICROARRAYS SCREENED WITH MOUSE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES (MABS) AND HUMAN MABS TO SD1 ISOLATED FROM COLOMBIAN STUDY POPULATIONS. EPITOPES WILL BE SYNTHESIZED AS PEPTIDE- CONJUGATES OR WITHIN ENGINEERED RECOMBINANT DOMAINS, AND IMMUNOGENICITY WILL BE OPTIMIZED IN AIM 2 TO PRODUCE ANTIBODIES WITH FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY AGAINST PARASITES THAT EXPRESS DIVERSE ALLELES OF VAR2CSA. IN THE THIRD AIM, THE CRYPTIC EPITOPES IN VAR2CSA RECOGNIZED BY THESE ANTIBODIES WILL BE MAPPED TO IDENTIFY THE TARGETS OF ANTIBODIES ELICITED BY AN SD1-DERIVED VACCINE. THE INTEGRATION OF THESE FINDINGS WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT INSIGHT INTO THE MECHANISM OF CROSS-SPECIES EPITOPE RECOGNITION, WHICH WILL SERVE AS THE BASIS FOR A VIVAX VACCINE AGAINST FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL MALARIA AND COULD BE APPLIED MORE BROADLY TO VACCINES AGAINST OTHER MALARIA ANTIGENS.|EXPLOITING CROSS-REACTIVE, CONSERVED EPITOPES IN PLASMODIUM VIVAX TO DEVELOP A VACCINE AGAINST FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL MALARIA. - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A VACCINE IS URGENTLY NEEDED TO PROTECT PREGNANT WOMEN FROM MALARIA INFECTION AND THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF THIS DISEASE ON MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH.

THERE IS NO EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR CHRONIC CHAGAS DISEASE AND RESISTANT STRAINS TO THE CURRENT FRONTLINE TREATMENT HAVE ALREADY EMERGED.

BY DESIGNING A SMALL GRANTS PROGRAM THAT ATTENDS TO THE MOST IMMEDIATE MANAGEMENT NEEDS OF INDIGENOUS LANDS IN THE REGION THROUGH THE ACTIVE PARTICIPATION OF LOCAL INDIGENOUS LEADERS, A CRUCIAL INFLUX OF FINANCING FOR SMALL PROJECTS TO ALLOW THESE ORGANIZATIONS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE DIFFICULT PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING PNGATI IN EACH OF ITS SEVEN THEMATIC FOCI.
 
 THE REGION CONTEMPLATED BY THE PROJECT ENCOMPASSES NEARLY 8 MILLION HECTARES IN WHICH OVER 50 INDIGENOUS LANDS ARE LOCATED. THE PROJECT WORKS IN SIX MUNICIPALITIES IN THE SOUTH OF AMAZONAS STATE   FIVE IN THE PURUS RIVER BASIN AND ONE IN THE MADEIRA RIVER BASIN   AND BENEFITS SEVEN INDIGENOUS ORGANIZATIONS. THE PROJECT IS ADMINISTERED BY A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION OF BRAZIL (IEB) AND THE NATIVE AMAZONIAN OPERATION. BOTH OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH INDIGENOUS PEOPLES IN THE REGION AND HAVE DEVELOPED LONG-LASTING RELATIONSHIPS AND COMMITMENTS WITH LOCAL INDIGENOUS ORGANIZATIONS. THE PROJECT IS PLANNED FOR A DURATION OF 3 YEARS, TO BE GOVERNED BY AN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE COMPRISED OF 4 MEMBERS   2 EACH FROM IEB AND OPAN. THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WILL ATTEND YEARLY MEETINGHS AND TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE OVERALL PLANNING, MONITORING AND EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT. THE MONITORING AND EVALUATION OF PROJECT ACTIONS ARE TO BE CONDUCTED AT THREE LEVELS: (I) ACTIVITY LEVEL; (II) COMPONENT LEVEL; AND (III) PROJECT LEVEL.
 
 THE WIDESPREAD AND EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF PNGATI IN ITS MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS BY STRENGTHENED INDIGENOUS ORGANIZATIONS, TOGETHER WITH THEIR GOVERNMENTAL AND CIVIL SOCIETY PARTNERS, IS THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THE PROJECT.  FOR ACHIEVING THIS GOAL FOUR KEY RESULTS ARE LISTED BELOW; ONE FOR EACH OF THE PROJECT S FOUR COMPONENTS:

 - STRENGTHENING OF THE ARTICULATION OF INDIGENOUS WOMEN OF MARANHÃO   AMIMA, CURRENTLY HOUSED IN COAPIMA,  THAT REPRESENTS ALL THE INDIGENOUS WOMEN IN THE STATE. STRENGTHENING WILL TAKE PLACE BY SUPPORT FOR POLICY ARTICULATION AND HOLDING OF ASSEMBLIES, AMONG OTHER ASPECTS. 
 - A SMALL AND MICRO GRANTS FUND FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND TERRITORIAL MANAGEMENT TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY PROJECTS. THERE ARE GOING TO BE TWO GRANT SUPPORT CYCLES, INTERSPERSED WITH ACTIVITIES FOR PLANNING, MONITORING AND ORIENTATION OF ACTIONS TOGETHER WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES. THE FUND WILL FUNCTION WITH MECHANISMS ESTABLISHED BY ISPN FOR THIS FINANCING MODALITY, ACCORDING TO THE FOLLOWING STEPS: 
 - BEFORE LAUNCHING THE CALL FOR PROPOSALS, WORKSHOPS AND MEETINGS ARE HELD TO DISSEMINATE AND BUILD CAPACITY ON PROJECT PREPARATION WITH INDIGENOUS ORGANIZATIONS IN THE REGION.
 -AFTER LAUNCHING THE CALL FOR PROPOSALS, PROPOSALS RECEIVED ARE SCREENED TO VERIFY IF THE INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED ARE COMPLETE. 
 -PROPOSALS ARE ANALYZED BY A SELECTION COMMITTEE COMPOSED OF PROFESSIONALS WITH SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL EXPERIENCE AND FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS, INCLUDING REPRESENTATIVES FROM ISPN, CTI, COAPIMA AND WYTY CATË. 
 -PROPONENTS FROM SELECTED PROJECTS ARE CALLED TO PARTICIPATE IN AN INITIAL CAPACITY BUILDING WORKSHOP, WHERE WORK PLANS AND PROJECT BUDGETS ARE CONSOLIDATED TOGETHER WITH ISPN TECHNICAL STAFF. AFTER PARTICIPATION IN THE WORKSHOP, PROJECTS PROCEED TO CONTRACT SIGNATURE WITH ISPN/CTI. 
 -THE FIRST TRANCHE IS DEPOSITED IN THE ACCOUNT OF THE PROJECT PROPONENT SO THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROJECT CAN BEGIN. WHEN THE PROJECT REACHES 70% OF THE AMOUNT SPENT OF THE TRANCHE RECEIVED, AS TESTIFIED BY THE PERFORMANCE REPORT, THE NEXT TRANCHE CAN BE REQUESTED.

 THE NATIONAL POLICY FOR THE TERRITORIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT OF INDIGENOUS LANDS (PNGATI) OF 2012 IS AN IMPORTANT FRAMEWORK FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF INDIGENOUS LANDS IN BRAZIL. THE MAIN CONSTRAINTS TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PNGATI IN THE SOUTH OF AMAZONAS STATE ARE A LACK OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND TECHNICAL EXPERTISE IN THE WRITING AND ADMINISTRATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND PRODUCTIVE PROJECTS BY INDIGENOUS ORGANIZATIONS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THEIR TERRITORIES.
 
 THIS PROJECT DIRECTLY ADDRESSES THESE CONSTRAINTS IN AN EFFORT TO CATALYZE AN INCIPIENT PROCESS OF TERRITORIAL MANAGEMENT BY LOCAL INDIGENOUS ORGANIZATIONS.

THE MONITORING AND EVALUATION OF PROJECT ACTIONS ARE TO BE CONDUCTED AT THREE LEVELS: (I) ACTIVITY LEVEL; (II) COMPONENT LEVEL; AND (III) PROJECT LEVEL.
 
 THE WIDESPREAD AND EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF PNGATI IN ITS MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS BY STRENGTHENED INDIGENOUS ORGANIZATIONS, TOGETHER WITH THEIR GOVERNMENTAL AND CIVIL SOCIETY PARTNERS, IS THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THE PROJECT.  FOR ACHIEVING THIS GOAL FOUR KEY RESULTS ARE LISTED BELOW; ONE FOR EACH OF THE PROJECT S FOUR COMPONENTS:

THE MAIN CONSTRAINTS TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PNGATI IN THE SOUTH OF AMAZONAS STATE ARE A LACK OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND TECHNICAL EXPERTISE IN THE WRITING AND ADMINISTRATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND PRODUCTIVE PROJECTS BY INDIGENOUS ORGANIZATIONS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THEIR TERRITORIES.
 
 THIS PROJECT DIRECTLY ADDRESSES THESE CONSTRAINTS IN AN EFFORT TO CATALYZE AN INCIPIENT PROCESS OF TERRITORIAL MANAGEMENT BY LOCAL INDIGENOUS ORGANIZATIONS.

THE MONITORING AND EVALUATION OF PROJECT ACTIONS ARE TO BE CONDUCTED AT THREE LEVELS: (I) ACTIVITY LEVEL; (II) COMPONENT LEVEL; AND (III) PROJECT LEVEL.
 
 THE WIDESPREAD AND EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF PNGATI IN ITS MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS BY STRENGTHENED INDIGENOUS ORGANIZATIONS, TOGETHER WITH THEIR GOVERNMENTAL AND CIVIL SOCIETY PARTNERS, IS THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THE PROJECT.  FOR ACHIEVING THIS GOAL FOUR KEY RESULTS ARE LISTED BELOW; ONE FOR EACH OF THE PROJECT S FOUR COMPONENTS:

IN THE R21 GRANT, PERIPHERAL SENSORY STIMULATION (PSS) WAS APPLIED TO ENHANCE EFFECTS OF TRAINING IN PATIENTS IN WITH STROKE. IN PSS, ELECTRICAL CURRENTS ARE DELIVERED TO PERIPHERAL NERVES, IN THE ABSENCE OF PAIN. INCREASE IN SENSORY INPUT BY PSS ENHANCES EXCITABILITY OF BRAIN MOTOR AREAS AND CAN IMPROVE HAND MOTOR PERFORMANCE, AS DEMONSTRATED BY RESULTS FROM OUR R-21 GRANT AND FROM OTHER STUDIES. ANOTHER PAINLESS EMERGING TECHNIQUE TO ENHANCE MOTOR FUNCTION IS TRANSCRANIAL DIRECT CURRENT STIMULATION (TDCS) THAT ENHANCES BRAIN EXCITABILITY NON-INVASIVELY. MOST NEUROMODULATION RESEARCH TO IMPROVE MOTOR FUNCTION IN STROKE HAS FOCUSED ON PATIENTS WITH MILD HAND MOTOR IMPAIRMENT. THIS GRANT PROPOSAL WILL BUILD ON RESULTS OF THE R-21, BY USING A NOVEL APPROACH TO TREAT PATIENTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE HAND WEAKNESS IN THE CHRONIC PHASE AFTER STROKE, TO WHOM THERE ARE VIRTUALLY NO UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED OPTIONS TO DECREASE HAND DISABILITY. IN THESE PATIENTS, ELECTRICAL CURRENTS DELIVERED TO MUSCLES IN THE FORM OF FUNCTIONAL ELECTRICAL STIMULATION (FES) CAN ASSIST MOVEMENT PERFORMANCE AND MOTOR TRAINING. WE WILL COMBINE FES, PSS AND TDCS IN AN INNOVATIVE STRATEGY. THE FIRST AIM OF THIS GRANT IS TO COMPARE EFFECTS OF A SINGLE SESSION OF FES IN CLOSE ASSOCIATION WITH EITHER TDCS ALONE, PSS ALONE, TDCS + PNS OR SHAM TDCS + SHAM PSS, ON MOTOR IMPAIRMENT OF PATIENTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE UPPER LIMB WEAKNESS IN THE CHRONIC PHASE AFTER STROKE. THE SECOND AIM IS TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF SEVERAL SESSIONS OF THE MOST POWERFUL NEUROMODULATION INTERVENTION ACCORDING TO RESULTS OF AIM 1, AND EFFECTS OF PLACEBO (SHAM PSS/TDCS) COMBINED WITH FES + TASK-SPECIFIC TRAINING, ON THE ABILITY TO PERFORM ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING. IN AIM 2, THE INTERVENTIONS WILL BE ADMINISTERED OVER SIX WEEKS TO TWO GROUPS OF ADULT STROKE PATIENTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE HAND WEAKNESS.

A STRONG PARTNERSHIP WAS DEVELOPED BETWEEN THE NEUROSTIMULATION LABORATORY AND THE HUMAN CORTICAL PHYSIOLOGY AND STROKE REHABILITATION SECTION AT NINDS.

THE CATASTROPHIC BURDEN OF STROKE AND THE SCARCITY OF EVIDENCE-BASED REHABILITATION INTERVENTIONS TO DECREASE DISABILITY FROM STROKE REPRESENT A MAJOR CHALLENGE TO GLOBAL HEALTH CARE. THERE IS A GAP BETWEEN STUDIES IN ANIMALS DEMONSTRATING ""REWIRING"" OF NEURONAL CIRCUITS AND AVAILABILITY OF NEUROREHABILITATIVE STRATEGIES TO RESTORE INDEPENDENT LIVING IN THE CLINICAL DOMAIN. BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE TO IMPLEMENT RESEARCH IN STROKE REHABILITATION HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AT THE NEUROSTIMULATION LABORATORY AT HOSPITAL DAS CLMNICAS/ SAO PAULO UNIVERSITY/ FUNDAGAO FACULDADE DE MEDICINA, BRAZIL, IN GREAT PART DUE TO A PREVIOUS SUCCESSFUL R21 GRANT FUNDED BY NIH. A STRONG PARTNERSHIP WAS DEVELOPED BETWEEN THE NEUROSTIMULATION LABORATORY AND THE HUMAN CORTICAL PHYSIOLOGY AND STROKE REHABILITATION SECTION AT NINDS. IN THE R21 GRANT, PERIPHERAL SENSORY STIMULATION (PSS) WAS APPLIED TO ENHANCE EFFECTS OF TRAINING IN PATIENTS IN WITH STROKE. IN PSS, ELECTRICAL CURRENTS ARE DELIVERED TO PERIPHERAL NERVES, IN THE ABSENCE OF PAIN. INCREASE IN SENSORY INPUT BY PSS ENHANCES EXCITABILITY OF BRAIN MOTOR AREAS AND CAN IMPROVE HAND MOTOR PERFORMANCE, AS DEMONSTRATED BY RESULTS FROM OUR R-21 GRANT AND FROM OTHER STUDIES. ANOTHER PAINLESS EMERGING TECHNIQUE TO ENHANCE MOTOR FUNCTION IS TRANSCRANIAL DIRECT CURRENT STIMULATION (TDCS) THAT ENHANCES BRAIN EXCITABILITY NON-INVASIVELY. MOST NEUROMODULATION RESEARCH TO IMPROVE MOTOR FUNCTION IN STROKE HAS FOCUSED ON PATIENTS WITH MILD HAND MOTOR IMPAIRMENT. THIS GRANT PROPOSAL WILL BUILD ON RESULTS OF THE R-21, BY USING A NOVEL APPROACH TO TREAT PATIENTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE HAND WEAKNESS IN THE CHRONIC PHASE AFTER STROKE, TO WHOM THERE ARE VIRTUALLY NO UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED OPTIONS TO DECREASE HAND DISABILITY. IN THESE PATIENTS, ELECTRICAL CURRENTS DELIVERED TO MUSCLES IN THE FORM OF FUNCTIONAL ELECTRICAL STIMULATION (FES) CAN ASSIST MOVEMENT PERFORMANCE AND MOTOR TRAINING. WE WILL COMBINE FES, PSS AND TDCS IN AN INNOVATIVE STRATEGY. THE FIRST AIM OF THIS GRANT IS TO COMPARE EFFECTS OF A SINGLE SESSION OF FES IN CLOSE ASSOCIATION WITH EITHER TDCS ALONE, PSS ALONE, TDCS + PNS OR SHAM TDCS + SHAM PSS, ON MOTOR IMPAIRMENT OF PATIENTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE UPPER LIMB WEAKNESS IN THE CHRONIC PHASE AFTER STROKE. THE SECOND AIM IS TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF SEVERAL SESSIONS OF THE MOST POWERFUL NEUROMODULATION INTERVENTION ACCORDING TO RESULTS OF AIM 1, AND EFFECTS OF PLACEBO (SHAM PSS/TDCS) COMBINED WITH FES + TASK-SPECIFIC TRAINING, ON THE ABILITY TO PERFORM ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING.

THE CATASTROPHIC BURDEN OF STROKE AND THE SCARCITY OF EVIDENCE-BASED REHABILITATION INTERVENTIONS TO DECREASE DISABILITY FROM STROKE REPRESENT A MAJOR CHALLENGE TO GLOBAL HEALTH CARE.

BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE TO IMPLEMENT RESEARCH IN STROKE REHABILITATION HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AT THE NEUROSTIMULATION LABORATORY AT HOSPITAL DAS CLMNICAS/ SAO PAULO UNIVERSITY/ FUNDAGAO FACULDADE DE MEDICINA, BRAZIL, IN GREAT PART DUE TO A PREVIOUS SUCCESSFUL R21 GRANT FUNDED BY NIH. A STRONG PARTNERSHIP WAS DEVELOPED BETWEEN THE NEUROSTIMULATION LABORATORY AND THE HUMAN CORTICAL PHYSIOLOGY AND STROKE REHABILITATION SECTION AT NINDS. IN THE R21 GRANT, PERIPHERAL SENSORY STIMULATION (PSS) WAS APPLIED TO ENHANCE EFFECTS OF TRAINING IN PATIENTS IN WITH STROKE. IN PSS, ELECTRICAL CURRENTS ARE DELIVERED TO PERIPHERAL NERVES, IN THE ABSENCE OF PAIN. INCREASE IN SENSORY INPUT BY PSS ENHANCES EXCITABILITY OF BRAIN MOTOR AREAS AND CAN IMPROVE HAND MOTOR PERFORMANCE, AS DEMONSTRATED BY RESULTS FROM OUR R-21 GRANT AND FROM OTHER STUDIES. ANOTHER PAINLESS EMERGING TECHNIQUE TO ENHANCE MOTOR FUNCTION IS TRANSCRANIAL DIRECT CURRENT STIMULATION (TDCS) THAT ENHANCES BRAIN EXCITABILITY NON-INVASIVELY. MOST NEUROMODULATION RESEARCH TO IMPROVE MOTOR FUNCTION IN STROKE HAS FOCUSED ON PATIENTS WITH MILD HAND MOTOR IMPAIRMENT. THIS GRANT PROPOSAL WILL BUILD ON RESULTS OF THE R-21, BY USING A NOVEL APPROACH TO TREAT PATIENTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE HAND WEAKNESS IN THE CHRONIC PHASE AFTER STROKE, TO WHOM THERE ARE VIRTUALLY NO UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED OPTIONS TO DECREASE HAND DISABILITY. IN THESE PATIENTS, ELECTRICAL CURRENTS DELIVERED TO MUSCLES IN THE FORM OF FUNCTIONAL ELECTRICAL STIMULATION (FES) CAN ASSIST MOVEMENT PERFORMANCE AND MOTOR TRAINING. WE WILL COMBINE FES, PSS AND TDCS IN AN INNOVATIVE STRATEGY. THE FIRST AIM OF THIS GRANT IS TO COMPARE EFFECTS OF A SINGLE SESSION OF FES IN CLOSE ASSOCIATION WITH EITHER TDCS ALONE, PSS ALONE, TDCS + PNS OR SHAM TDCS + SHAM PSS, ON MOTOR IMPAIRMENT OF PATIENTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE UPPER LIMB WEAKNESS IN THE CHRONIC PHASE AFTER STROKE. THE SECOND AIM IS TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF SEVERAL SESSIONS OF THE MOST POWERFUL NEUROMODULATION INTERVENTION ACCORDING TO RESULTS OF AIM 1, AND EFFECTS OF PLACEBO (SHAM PSS/TDCS) COMBINED WITH FES + TASK-SPECIFIC TRAINING, ON THE ABILITY TO PERFORM ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING.

ASST_NON_R01NS064905_7529|R01NS064905|-42230.58|1165107.58|CHADSS: CHAGAS DISEASE SCAN STUDY - DESCRIPTION (PROVIDED BY APPLICANT): STROKE IS AN ENORMOUS INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN, PARTICULARLY IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD WHERE THERE ARE LIMITED RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE FOR AN AGING POPULATION. ONE OF THE MAIN CONTRIBUTORS TO STROKE INCIDENCE IS THE HIGHLY PREVALENT CHAGAS DISEASE, A PARASITIC INFECTION AFFECTING AN ESTIMATED 18 MILLION INDIVIDUALS AND A MAJOR CAUSE OF HEART FAILURE IN LATIN AMERICA. CHAGAS DISEASE CONVEYS STROKE RISK THROUGH TWO ESTABLISHED MECHANISMS: STRUCTURAL CARDIAC DISEASE AND CHRONIC INFLAMMATION. ALTHOUGH INFLAMMATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED RISK OF ISCHEMIC STROKE AND POORER OUTCOME, ITS ROLE HAS BEEN LARGELY LINKED TO ATHEROGENESIS. CHRONIC INFLAMMATION CAN RESULT IN ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION AND STIMULATE THE HEMOSTATIC SYSTEM, INCREASING SYSTEMIC FIBRIN PRODUCTION AND PLATELET ACTIVATION. BRAIN ATROPHY HAS ALSO BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH CHRONIC INFLAMMATION. ADULTS, YOUNG AND OLD, WHO DEVELOP A SECONDARY CARDIOMYOPATHY FROM CHAGAS ARE THEREFORE AT HIGHER RISK OF CARDIOEMBOLISM AND NEURODEGENERATION. STROKE PATIENTS USUALLY SURVIVE, BUT CAN BE LEFT WITH SIGNIFICANT DISABILITY AFFECTING THEIR HEALTH STATUS, PRODUCTIVITY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE. THESE FACTORS IMPACT CAREGIVERS AS WELL. THUS, THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF STROKE ARE VAST.

ONE OF THE MAIN CONTRIBUTORS TO STROKE INCIDENCE IS THE HIGHLY PREVALENT CHAGAS DISEASE, A PARASITIC INFECTION AFFECTING AN ESTIMATED 18 MILLION INDIVIDUALS AND A MAJOR CAUSE OF HEART FAILURE IN LATIN AMERICA. CHAGAS DISEASE CONVEYS STROKE RISK THROUGH TWO ESTABLISHED MECHANISMS: STRUCTURAL CARDIAC DISEASE AND CHRONIC INFLAMMATION. ALTHOUGH INFLAMMATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED RISK OF ISCHEMIC STROKE AND POORER OUTCOME, ITS ROLE HAS BEEN LARGELY LINKED TO ATHEROGENESIS. CHRONIC INFLAMMATION CAN RESULT IN ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION AND STIMULATE THE HEMOSTATIC SYSTEM, INCREASING SYSTEMIC FIBRIN PRODUCTION AND PLATELET ACTIVATION. BRAIN ATROPHY HAS ALSO BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH CHRONIC INFLAMMATION. ADULTS, YOUNG AND OLD, WHO DEVELOP A SECONDARY CARDIOMYOPATHY FROM CHAGAS ARE THEREFORE AT HIGHER RISK OF CARDIOEMBOLISM AND NEURODEGENERATION. STROKE PATIENTS USUALLY SURVIVE, BUT CAN BE LEFT WITH SIGNIFICANT DISABILITY AFFECTING THEIR HEALTH STATUS, PRODUCTIVITY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE. THESE FACTORS IMPACT CAREGIVERS AS WELL. THUS, THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF STROKE ARE VAST. DURING OUR R21 PLANNING GRANT PERIOD, WE WERE ABLE TO ESTABLISH A COLLABORATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE BETWEEN THE RESEARCH GROUPS IN BRAZIL AND THE UNITED STATES AND COLLECT PRELIMINARY DATA.

TST MEASURES AN IN VIVO CELLULAR REACTION MEDIATED BY TH1 CELLS AT THE SITE OF TUBERCULIN INJECTION. ALTHOUGH TST DETECTS PREVIOUS EXPOSURE TO MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS (MTB), IT PRESENTS LOW SPECIFICITY AND IS NOT CAPABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE LATENT INFECTION FROM ACTIVE TB DISEASE. FEW YEARS AGO, THE IDENTIFICATION OF HIGHLY SPECIFIC RD1 REGION IN MTB GENOME DROVE THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW IN VITRO TB SPECIFIC TESTS. THE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE QUANTIFERON(R) TB GOLD IN TUBE6 IS AN EXAMPLE OF SUCH IN VITRO TESTS (ALSO KNOWN AS IGRA). IGRA DETECTS IFN- RELEASED FROM LYMPHOCYTES AFTER IN VITRO INCUBATION WITH MTB ANTIGENS. AS OPPOSED TO TST, IGRA OFFER ENHANCED SPECIFICITY AND ARE NOT INFLUENCED BY CROSS-REACTIVITY TO BCG AND OTHER NON-TUBERCULOUS MYCOBACTERIA (NTM). HOWEVER, IT IS STILL CONTROVERSIAL WHETHER IGRA CAN REPLACE TST AS THE DIAGNOSTIC TEST OF CHOICE. ALTHOUGH IGRA IS, BY DEFINITION, MORE SPECIFIC THAN TST, SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE REPORTED AN ELEVATED FREQUENCY OF IGRA REVERSIONS AND CONVERSIONS7-15 AS WELL AS DISCORDANCE BETWEEN IGRA AND TST 4, 16, 17.

BRUCELLA ABORTUS STRAIN 19 VACCINE, DEVELOPED IN THE 1930S, IS THE PRINCIPAL VACCINE USED TO PREVENT TRANSMISSION OF BRUCELLOSIS FROM CATTLE TO HUMANS WORLDWIDE AND IN BRAZIL. THE MECHANISMS THAT MEDIATE PROTECTION BY STRAIN 19 ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD. HOST MECHANISMS OF INNATE IMMUNITY INDUCED BY THE VACCINE THAT CONTROL INFECTION REMAIN OBSCURE. INDEED, THE VACCINE CONTAINS SEVERAL PROPERTIES THAT ARE INHIBITORY TO HOST IMMUNITY. OUR RESEARCH GROUP WAS THE FIRST TO IMPLICATE THE ROLE OF INFLAMMASOME RECEPTORS IN THE CONTROL OF BRUCELLA ABORTUS INFECTION. FURTHER, OUR TEAM HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT IFN-ASSR KO MICE ARE MORE RESISTANT TO INFECTION SUGGESTING THAT TYPE I IFN SIGNALING FAVORS BRUCELLA MULTIPLICATION IN THE HOST. THEREFORE, OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO RESOLVE THE CONUNDRUM OF HOW BRUCELLA ACTIVATES INNATE IMMUNE COMPONENTS THAT RESULTS IN HOST RESISTANCE VERSUS BACTERIAL SUBVERSION OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE. BRUCELLA SPP ARE ONE OF THE FEW BACTERIAL PATHOGENS THAT USE THE ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM (ER) AS ITS REPLICATIVE NICHE. THE UNFOLDED PROTEIN RESPONSE (UPR) IS A CONSERVED SIGNALING PATHWAY IN EUKARYOTES THAT MEDIATES CELLULAR ADAPTATION TO PROTEIN-FOLDING STRESS IN THE ER. THE UPR ALSO MODULATES INNATE IMMUNITY. RECENTLY, OUR COLLABORATORS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT BRUCELLA INDUCES THE UPR THAT ENABLES ITS INTRACELLULAR REPLICATION. BASED ON THESE COMPELLING PRELIMINARY DATA, WE PROPOSE TO TEST THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS THAT BRUCELLA ABORTUS STRAIN 19 ACTIVATES PROTECTIVE INNATE IMMUNE MEDIATORS AND TRIGGERS THE UPR TO SECURE INTRACELLULAR REPLICATION. FURTHER, WE PROPOSE THAT THE STRAIN 19 INDUCED UPR REGULATES CYTOKINE PRODUCTION. OUR SPECIFIC AIMS ARE TO DETERMINE WHETHER: 1) NLRP3 INFLAMMASOME ACTIVATION AND IL-1SS SECRETION INDUCED BY BRUCELLA REQUIRES THE UPR; 2) THE BACTERIAL VIRULENCE FACTOR SS TCPB THAT MODULATES HOST CELL MICROTUBULES ACTIVATES THE NLRP3 INFLAMMASOME AND IL-1SS AND 3) THE UPR ACTIVATED BY BRUCELLA ABORTUS STRAIN 19 REGULATES STING EXPRESSION AND TYPE I INTERFERON PRODUCTION TO FACILITATE BACTERIAL PERSISTENCE. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR APPROACH WILL SHED LIGHT ON THE MECHANISMS OF IMMUNITY AGAINST THIS IMPORTANT HUMAN AND ANIMAL PATHOGEN. ADDITIONALLY, CRITICAL INFORMATION GAINED FROM THESE SPECIFIC AIMS WILL BEGIN TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT MECHANISMS OF PROTECTION INDUCED BY B. ABORTUS VACCINE STRAIN 19 AND HOW BACTERIAL PERSISTENCE IS REGULATED.

A RECENT SYSTEMATIC REVIEW IDENTIFIED A HIGH PREVALENCE OF LIFETIME PHYSICAL (68%) OR SEXUAL VIOLENCE (49%) AMONG TGW. FREQUENT EXPERIENCES OF VIOLENCE CONTRIBUTES TO HIGH LEVELS OF POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD), GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER (GAD), SUICIDALITY, SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER (SUD) AND MIGHT INFLUENCE THE ONSET, PROGRESSION, AND PROGNOSIS OF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (MDD) AMONG TGW. SINCE 2008 BRAZIL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE THAN 40% OF ALL TRANSGENDER HOMICIDES REPORTED WORLDWIDE. IN 2016/17 WE CONDUCTED A SURVEY WITH 2,846 TGW FROM TWELVE BRAZILIAN CITIES, IDENTIFYING 60% PREVALENCE OF LIFETIME VIOLENCE (PHYSICAL AND/OR SEXUAL), 60% OF PARTICIPANTS SCREENED POSITIVE FOR MDD, 38% FOR GAD, AND 35% ATTEMPTED SUICIDE. THE MAJORITY OF VIOLENT INCIDENTS WERE NOT REPORTED TO THE POLICE (91%) AND MOST VICTIMS DID NOT RECEIVE ANY COUNSELING OR MENTAL HEALTH (MH) TREATMENT (82%). ON THIS RESUBMISSION, WE WILL UTILIZE COMMUNITY-BASED PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH (CBPR) TO ADAPT THE “UNI-FORM” APP AND ONLINE PLATFORM (HTTPS://UNI-FORM.EU) TO TGW FROM BRAZIL. THE STUDY SPECIFIC AIMS ARE: (1) REFINE AND ADAPT THE “UNI-FORM” MHEALTH INTERVENTION TO BRAZIL (RISE), INCLUDING MH SCREENING AND LINK TO MH CARE; (2) PILOT TEST RISE TO PREVENT VIOLENCE, IMPROVE MH SCREENING AND TREATMENT; AND (3) EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF RISE. THIS R21 EXPLORATORY PROJECT PROPOSES TO RECRUIT 200 TGW FROM RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL TO STUDY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF RISE. CONSISTENT WITH NIMH GOAL TO ENHANCE RESEARCH CAPACITY, THE PROPOSAL IS LED BY AN EARLY STAGE INVESTIGATOR AND INCLUDES A CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH RESEARCHERS FROM DUKE WHO WILL PROVIDE CONSTANT SUPERVISION FROM RESEARCHERS WITH SENIOR EXPERTISE IN SGM MHEALTH (DR. LEGRAND), SGM MH INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH (DR. WHETTEN), MH AND IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE (DR. BELDEN). THIS PROPOSAL IS INNOVATIVE IN SEVERAL WAYS: IT WILL ADAPT TO BRAZIL AN EXISTING MHEALTH INTERVENTION ADDRESSING SGM-RELATED VIOLENCE (UNI-FORM), TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FEATURES TO INCREASE MH SCREENING AND LINKAGE TO MH CARE. THE PROPOSED APP, RISE, HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE CRISES RESPONSE AND PROMOTE TIMELY MH CARE AMONG A HIGH-RISK POPULATION: TGW. IT HAS SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT: THE INTERVENTION WILL PREVENT AND RESPOND TO VIOLENCE AGAINST TGW, IN A COUNTRY WITH THE HIGHEST RATE OF TRANSGENDER MURDERS IN THE WORLD. IT WILL ALSO DEVELOP AN INNOVATIVE STRATEGY TO IDENTIFY AND LINK TO CARE TGW WHO NEED MH CARE, A POPULATION WITH HIGH PREVALENCE OF PTSD, GAD, MDD, SUD AND SUICIDALITY. THOSE MENTAL DISORDERS ARE UNDERSCREENED, UNDERDIAGNOSED, AND UNDERTREATED AMONG TGW. IF SUCCESSFUL, THE INTERVENTION COULD BE SCALED UP AND ADAPTED TO OTHER POPULATIONS AND COUNTRIES. THIS RESEARCH WILL YIELD THE CRUCIAL FIRST STEPS IN DEVELOPING A LOWER COST AND EFFICACIOUS MHEALTH INTERVENTION THAT WE PLAN TO EVALUATE WITH AN RCT IN A SUBSEQUENT R01. RISE ADDRESSES ALL THREE NIMH PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED IN THE NOTICE OF SPECIAL INTEREST IN RESEARCH ON HEALTH OF SGM POPULATIONS (NOT-MD-19-001), GRAND CHALLENGES IN GLOBAL MENTAL HEALTH AND NIMH STRATEGIC AIM 3."|"RISE STUDY (""RESIST, INTERVENE, SUPPORT, EMPOWER""): FEASIBILITY/ACCEPTABILITY OF MHEALTH INTERVENTION TARGETING TRANSGENDER WOMEN FACING GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE AND MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS IN BRAZIL - TRANSGENDER WOMEN (TGW) DISPROPORTIONATELY EXPERIENCE PHYSICAL/SEXUAL VIOLENCE WHEN COMPARED WITH THE GENERAL POPULATION AND WITH OTHER SEXUAL AND GENDER MINORITIES (SGMS). A RECENT SYSTEMATIC REVIEW IDENTIFIED A HIGH PREVALENCE OF LIFETIME PHYSICAL (68%) OR SEXUAL VIOLENCE (49%) AMONG TGW. FREQUENT EXPERIENCES OF VIOLENCE CONTRIBUTES TO HIGH LEVELS OF POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD), GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER (GAD), SUICIDALITY, SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER (SUD) AND MIGHT INFLUENCE THE ONSET, PROGRESSION, AND PROGNOSIS OF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (MDD) AMONG TGW. SINCE 2008 BRAZIL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE THAN 40% OF ALL TRANSGENDER HOMICIDES REPORTED WORLDWIDE. IN 2016/17 WE CONDUCTED A SURVEY WITH 2,846 TGW FROM TWELVE BRAZILIAN CITIES, IDENTIFYING 60% PREVALENCE OF LIFETIME VIOLENCE (PHYSICAL AND/OR SEXUAL), 60% OF PARTICIPANTS SCREENED POSITIVE FOR MDD, 38% FOR GAD, AND 35% ATTEMPTED SUICIDE. THE MAJORITY OF VIOLENT INCIDENTS WERE NOT REPORTED TO THE POLICE (91%) AND MOST VICTIMS DID NOT RECEIVE ANY COUNSELING OR MENTAL HEALTH (MH) TREATMENT (82%).

BEATRIZ GRINSZTEJN AND SUPPORTED BY A CADRE OF EXPERIENCED RESEARCHERS AND PROMISING JUNIOR INVESTIGATORS. FIOTRIALS IS AFFILIATED WITH FIOCRUZ, AN INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF EXCELLENCE IN THE FIELD OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES. THE FIOTRIALS CTU PROMOTES AND REWARDS INNOVATION, WHILE PROVIDING A STANDARDIZED, FORMAL APPROACH TO THE IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT OF CLINICAL TRIALS. THE CTU HAS SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED AND CONDUCTED PIVOTAL CLINICAL TRIALS FOR MULTIPLE NIH-SPONSORED NETWORKS THAT HAVE CHANGED THE LANDSCAPE OF HIV AND TUBERCULOSIS (TB) PREVENTION AND TREATMENT DURING THE LAST 14 YEARS.

THIS COMBINATION THERAPY DEMONSTRATED VERY HIGH EFFICACY IN CLINICAL TRIALS AND ACQUIRED DRUG RESISTANCE WAS ABSENT (FIRST-LINE TREATMENT) OR VERY RARE (SECOND-LINE TREATMENT). IT REMAINS TO BE DETERMINED WHETHER THIS HIGH EFFICACY AND LACK OF RESISTANCE DEVELOPMENT CAN BE EXTRAPOLATED TO TREATMENT OF NON-B SUBTYPE VIRUSES IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES WHERE MOST PLWH LIVE. OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO PROVIDE A SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR OPTIMAL LARGE-SCALE AND LONG-TERM TREATMENT OF PLWH WITH DTG. OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT NOVEL VIRAL MUTATIONS IN AND OUTSIDE THE INTEGRASE GENE (WITH AN EMPHASIS ON 3’-POLYPURINE TRACT CHANGES) CONTRIBUTE TO VIROLOGIC FAILURE WITH DTG IN CLINICAL PRACTICE. THIS HYPOTHESIS WILL BE TESTED BY IDENTIFYING PLWH FAILING DTG CONTAINING REGIMENS IN BRAZIL WHICH IS A MODEL COUNTRY FOR LARGE-SCALE DTG IMPLEMENTATION WHERE VARIOUS HIV SUBTYPES CO-CIRCULATE. SUBSEQUENTLY WE WILL PERFORM IN-DEPTH IN VITRO CHARACTERIZATIONS OF NOVEL VIRAL MUTATIONS IN AND OUTSIDE INTEGRASE GENE IN AN HIV SUBTYPE COMPARATIVE MANNER. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE: 1) TO CHARACTERIZE THE PATTERN OF INSTI RESISTANCE MUTATIONS THAT EMERGE DURING FAILURE OF DTG-CONTAINING CART IN INDIVIDUALS INFECTED WITH SUBTYPES C, F, AND BF RECOMBINANT FORMS IN BRAZIL. THESE ARE THE MOST PREVALENT NON-B SUBTYPES ON THE SOUTH-AMERICAN CONTINENT. 2) TO DETERMINE WHICH CHANGES IN THE 3’-PPT ARE OBSERVED IN VIRUSES FROM DTG FAILING INDIVIDUALS.

THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE INDIVIDUALS EXPOSED TO M. LEPRAE BECOMES INFECTED, BUT ONLY A SMALL PROPORTION OF THE INFECTED INDIVIDUALS EVOLVES TO ACTIVE DISEASE. PREVIOUS WORK IN LEPROSY AND TUBERCULOSIS DEMONSTRATED A MAJOR ROLE OF INTERFERON-, AN EFFECTOR CYTOKINE PRODUCED BY PATHOGEN-SPECIFIC MEMORY CD4 T CELLS, IN THE CONTROL OF THE INFECTION BY THESE INTRACELLULAR PATHOGENS. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA SHOW A PROGRESSIVE REDUCTION IN M. LEPRAE-SPECIFIC IFN LEVELS IN INDIVIDUALS THAT CORRELATES TO INDICATORS OF LEVEL OF EXPOSURE TO M. LEPRAE AND TO BACILLARY LOAD IN INDIVIDUALS WITH LEPROSY. WHEN WE EVALUATED THE INTERACTION OF M. LEPRAE WITH SCHWANN CELLS AND MONONUCLEAR PHAGOCYTES, WE OBSERVED AN INDUCTION OF THE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINE IL-10 AND THE LIPID MEDIATOR PGE-2. METABOLOMICS ANALYSES OF LESIONS AND SERA FROM LEPROSY PATIENTS ALSO DEMONSTRATED CLEAR DIFFERENCES IN THE PRESENCE OF POLYUNSATURATED FATTY ACID (PUFA) DERIVED LIPID MEDIATORS THAT CORRELATED TO THE CLINICAL FORMS OF LEPROSY AND BACILLARY LOADS.

IT WAS CREATED TO COORDINATE AND PROMOTE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH RELATED TO GLOBAL CHANGE IN THE AMERICAS AND TO BUILD SCIENTIFIC CAPACITY IN THE REGION IN ADDITION TO FOSTERING COLLABORATION AND COORDINATION OF SCIENCE ON GLOBAL CHANGE ACROSS NATIONAL BOUNDARIES. THE IAI SUPPORTS EXTENSIVE LONG-TERM COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH NETWORKS THAT INCREASE USE OF INTER- AND TRANSDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH ON GLOBAL CHANGE AS IT IMPACTS THE AMERICAS. THE INSTITUTE ALSO DEVELOPS TRAINING MATERIALS FOR CONSTITUENTS TO FOSTER THE INTEGRATION OF RESEARCH ACROSS DISCIPLINARY AND INTERNATIONAL BOUNDARIES. AS PART OF ITS OFFICE FUNCTIONS, THE IAI HELPS SUPPORT SCIENTIST/COMMUNITY/POLICY MAKER INTERACTIONS AND THE CO-DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH PROJECTS TO HELP BETTER UNDERSTAND COMPLEX PROBLEMS PLAGUING NATIONS IN THE AMERICAS THAT INVOLVE PHYSICO-CHEMICAL-HUMAN-ECOSYSTEM RELATED CHALLENGES RESULTING FROM GLOBAL CHANGE, THE SOLUTIONS OF WHICH INVOLVE ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF DIVERSE STAKEHOLDERS SUCH THAT THE RESULTS CAN BE USED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE SCIENCE-BASED POLICIES THAT SERVE LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND/OR NATIONAL AND REGIONAL AND/OR CROSS-BORDER INTERESTS. IN THIS REGARD AND IN RESPONSE TO ITS GOVERNING BODY OF NATIONS FROM ACROSS THE AMERICANS THAT DEFINE IAI'S AGENDA FOR EACH FUNDING PERIOD, THE INTER-AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR GLOBAL CHANGE RESEARCH WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT ITS COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH NETWORK PROGRAMS AND WILL ALSO ANALYZE AND MAKE PUBLIC BEST PRACTICES FOR ESTABLISHING INTER- AND TRANSDISCIPLINARY, INTERSECTIONAL TEAMS THAT CAN TACKLE PROBLEM-FOCUSED RESEARCH. BROADER IMPACTS OF THE WORK INCLUDE THE FOSTERING OF INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION BETWEEN AND AMONG SCIENTISTS, RESEARCH GROUPS, AND COUNTRIES ACROSS THE AMERICAS; CREATING EDUCATIONAL AND TRAINING MATERIALS FOR EFFECTIVE CREATION OF TRANSDISCIPLINARY SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH PROJECTS THAT ADDRESS PRESSING ISSUES RELATED TO GLOBAL CHANGE; ENCOURAGING THE ADOPTION OF OPEN DATA AND DATA SHARING PRACTICES; AND ENABLING THE PRODUCTION OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH RESULTS USEFUL TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS POLICY- AND DECISION-MAKERS. OTHER IMPACTS INCLUDE AN AGGRESSIVE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM FOR STUDENTS AND OTHERS THAT INCLUDES WORKSHOPS ON SCIENCE DIPLOMACY AND THE SCIENCE-TO-POLICY PROCESS. THE INTER-AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR GLOBAL CHANGE RESEARCH IS AN OFFICE THAT HAS AN EVOLVING SCIENCE AGENDA THAT IS DETERMINED, ON A REGULAR BASIS, BY ITS GOVERNING BODY, WHICH IS COMPRISED OF 19 COUNTRIES ACROSS THE AMERICAS. ITS SCIENCE AGENDA IS COMPLEMENTARY TO THE RESEARCH PRIORITIES OF THE US GLOBAL CHANGE RESEARCH PROGRAM. THE AWARD COVERS IAI DIRECTORATE STAFF SALARIES AND TRAVEL COSTS FOR ADMINISTERING THE OFFICE AND FOR INTERACTING WITH PARTNER STATES AND ITS RESEARCH COORDINATION NETWORKS.

TWO VACCINES ARE IN EARLY STAGE CLINICAL TRIALS AND BOTH TARGET DOMAINS WITHIN THE PROTEIN VAR2CSA, WHICH IS THE MAJOR SURFACE ANTIGEN EXPRESSED BY PLASMODIUM FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL ISOLATES. THIS PROTEIN BINDS TO RECEPTORS IN THE PLACENTA AND MEDIATES SEQUESTRATION OF INFECTED RED BLOOD CELLS (IRBCS), UNDERPINNING THE PATHOGENESIS OF PLACENTAL MALARIA. HOWEVER, VAR2CSA IS UNDER STRONG IMMUNE SELECTION AND IS HIGHLY POLYMORPHIC; THIS COMPROMISES VACCINE EFFICACY BY LIMITING THE BREADTH OF PROTECTION AGAINST DIVERSE ALLELES. POLYMORPHIC ANTIGENS PRESENT A UBIQUITOUS CHALLENGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MALARIA SUBUNIT VACCINES. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO A VACCINE AGAINST PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED MALARIA THAT TARGETS HIGHLY CONSERVED, SUBDOMINANT (EVEN CRYPTIC) EPITOPES. WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT THIS APPROACH IS THAT IT EXPLOITS A MECHANISM OF CROSS- SPECIES IMMUNITY, WHERE EPITOPES FROM ONE PLASMODIUM SPECIES ELICIT ROBUST, BROADLY NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES AGAINST STRUCTURALLY RELATED ANTIGENS FROM ANOTHER SPECIES. THIS MECHANISM WAS DISCOVERED RECENTLY IN COLOMBIAN AND BRAZILIAN POPULATIONS WHERE VAR2CSA ANTIBODIES CAN BE ACQUIRED OUTSIDE OF PREGNANCY FOLLOWING INFECTION WITH P. VIVAX, AND THESE ANTIBODIES BLOCKED SEQUESTRATION OF IRBCS USING IN VITRO CORRELATES OF PLACENTAL MALARIA. THE CROSS-REACTIVE EPITOPE IN P. VIVAX WAS MAPPED TO SUBDOMAIN (SD1) IN PVDBP AND HUMAN SD1-PURIFIED ANTIBODIES BLOCKED PARASITE ADHESION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A VACCINE TO PROTECT PREGNANT WOMEN FROM FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL MALARIA THAT IS BASED ON THE CROSS- REACTIVE EPITOPE IN VIVAX SD1. THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH SYNTHESIS OF THREE COMPLEMENTARY SPECIFIC AIMS. EPITOPES REQUIRED TO ELICIT FUNCTIONAL, CROSS-REACTIVE ANTIBODIES WILL BE IDENTIFIED IN AIM 1 THROUGH CONFORMATIONALLY CONSTRICTED PEPTIDE MICROARRAYS SCREENED WITH MOUSE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES (MABS) AND HUMAN MABS TO SD1 ISOLATED FROM COLOMBIAN STUDY POPULATIONS. EPITOPES WILL BE SYNTHESIZED AS PEPTIDE- CONJUGATES OR WITHIN ENGINEERED RECOMBINANT DOMAINS, AND IMMUNOGENICITY WILL BE OPTIMIZED IN AIM 2 TO PRODUCE ANTIBODIES WITH FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY AGAINST PARASITES THAT EXPRESS DIVERSE ALLELES OF VAR2CSA. IN THE THIRD AIM, THE CRYPTIC EPITOPES IN VAR2CSA RECOGNIZED BY THESE ANTIBODIES WILL BE MAPPED TO IDENTIFY THE TARGETS OF ANTIBODIES ELICITED BY AN SD1-DERIVED VACCINE. THE INTEGRATION OF THESE FINDINGS WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT INSIGHT INTO THE MECHANISM OF CROSS-SPECIES EPITOPE RECOGNITION, WHICH WILL SERVE AS THE BASIS FOR A VIVAX VACCINE AGAINST FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL MALARIA AND COULD BE APPLIED MORE BROADLY TO VACCINES AGAINST OTHER MALARIA ANTIGENS.|EXPLOITING CROSS-REACTIVE, CONSERVED EPITOPES IN PLASMODIUM VIVAX TO DEVELOP A VACCINE AGAINST FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL MALARIA. - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A VACCINE IS URGENTLY NEEDED TO PROTECT PREGNANT WOMEN FROM MALARIA INFECTION AND THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF THIS DISEASE ON MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH.

HOWEVER, VAR2CSA IS UNDER STRONG IMMUNE SELECTION AND IS HIGHLY POLYMORPHIC; THIS COMPROMISES VACCINE EFFICACY BY LIMITING THE BREADTH OF PROTECTION AGAINST DIVERSE ALLELES. POLYMORPHIC ANTIGENS PRESENT A UBIQUITOUS CHALLENGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MALARIA SUBUNIT VACCINES. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO A VACCINE AGAINST PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED MALARIA THAT TARGETS HIGHLY CONSERVED, SUBDOMINANT (EVEN CRYPTIC) EPITOPES. WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT THIS APPROACH IS THAT IT EXPLOITS A MECHANISM OF CROSS- SPECIES IMMUNITY, WHERE EPITOPES FROM ONE PLASMODIUM SPECIES ELICIT ROBUST, BROADLY NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES AGAINST STRUCTURALLY RELATED ANTIGENS FROM ANOTHER SPECIES. THIS MECHANISM WAS DISCOVERED RECENTLY IN COLOMBIAN AND BRAZILIAN POPULATIONS WHERE VAR2CSA ANTIBODIES CAN BE ACQUIRED OUTSIDE OF PREGNANCY FOLLOWING INFECTION WITH P. VIVAX, AND THESE ANTIBODIES BLOCKED SEQUESTRATION OF IRBCS USING IN VITRO CORRELATES OF PLACENTAL MALARIA. THE CROSS-REACTIVE EPITOPE IN P. VIVAX WAS MAPPED TO SUBDOMAIN (SD1) IN PVDBP AND HUMAN SD1-PURIFIED ANTIBODIES BLOCKED PARASITE ADHESION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A VACCINE TO PROTECT PREGNANT WOMEN FROM FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL MALARIA THAT IS BASED ON THE CROSS- REACTIVE EPITOPE IN VIVAX SD1. THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH SYNTHESIS OF THREE COMPLEMENTARY SPECIFIC AIMS. EPITOPES REQUIRED TO ELICIT FUNCTIONAL, CROSS-REACTIVE ANTIBODIES WILL BE IDENTIFIED IN AIM 1 THROUGH CONFORMATIONALLY CONSTRICTED PEPTIDE MICROARRAYS SCREENED WITH MOUSE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES (MABS) AND HUMAN MABS TO SD1 ISOLATED FROM COLOMBIAN STUDY POPULATIONS. EPITOPES WILL BE SYNTHESIZED AS PEPTIDE- CONJUGATES OR WITHIN ENGINEERED RECOMBINANT DOMAINS, AND IMMUNOGENICITY WILL BE OPTIMIZED IN AIM 2 TO PRODUCE ANTIBODIES WITH FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY AGAINST PARASITES THAT EXPRESS DIVERSE ALLELES OF VAR2CSA. IN THE THIRD AIM, THE CRYPTIC EPITOPES IN VAR2CSA RECOGNIZED BY THESE ANTIBODIES WILL BE MAPPED TO IDENTIFY THE TARGETS OF ANTIBODIES ELICITED BY AN SD1-DERIVED VACCINE. THE INTEGRATION OF THESE FINDINGS WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT INSIGHT INTO THE MECHANISM OF CROSS-SPECIES EPITOPE RECOGNITION, WHICH WILL SERVE AS THE BASIS FOR A VIVAX VACCINE AGAINST FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL MALARIA AND COULD BE APPLIED MORE BROADLY TO VACCINES AGAINST OTHER MALARIA ANTIGENS.|2023-03-28|Department of Health and Human Services|National Institutes of Health|THE GOVERNORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA||CANADA|CANADA|||||||

THERE IS NO EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR CHRONIC CHAGAS DISEASE AND RESISTANT STRAINS TO THE CURRENT FRONTLINE TREATMENT HAVE ALREADY EMERGED. THERE IS A GROWING NEED FOR NEW PHARMACOLOGICAL ALTERNATIVES TO TREAT THIS DISEASE.  THIS PROPOSAL EXPLOITS A TARGET-BASED APPROACH TO SEARCH FOR LEAD COMPOUNDS AGAINST CHAGAS DISEASE. TRYPANOSOMA CRUZI DIHYDROOROTATE DEHYDROGENASE (TCDHODH) IS A FLAVIN MONONUCLEOTIDE CONTAINING ENZYME, WHICH CATALYZES THE OXIDATION OF L-DIHYDROOROTATE TO OROTATE, THE FOURTH STEP AND ONLY REDOX REACTION IN THE DE NOVO BIOSYNTHESIS OF PYRIMIDINE NUCLEOTIDES. TCDHODH WAS ALSO DESCRIBED AS A SOLUBLE FUMARATE REDUCTASE PLAYING A ROLE IN CONNECTING SUCCINATE/FUMARATE METABOLISM TO DE NOVO PYRIMIDINE BIOSYNTHESIS. DHODH HAS ALREADY BEEN EXTENSIVELY EXPLOITED AS A DRUG TARGET FOR PROLIFERATIVE AND PARASITIC DISEASES. GENETIC STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT DHODH IS ESSENTIAL FOR T. CRUZI SURVIVAL PROVIDING EVIDENCE THAT THIS ENZYME IS AN ATTRACTIVE TARGET FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANTICHAGASIC DRUGS.  THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO CHEMICALLY VALIDATE TCDHODH AS A NEW DRUG TARGET FOR CHAGAS DISEASE AND TO PROVIDE LEADS FOR DRUG DEVELOPMENT. OUR APPROACH COMBINES MULTIPLE TECHNIQUES INCLUDING COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY, ENZYMOLOGY, STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY, PARASITOLOGY, AND MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY TO DEVELOP SELECTIVE AND COVALENT INHIBITORS OF TCDHODH. INITIALLY, WE WILL SEEK TO GAIN A GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF THE DHODH HOT SPOTS BY USING SOLVENT MAPPING TO CHARACTERIZE THE BINDING POCKETS WITH THE FLEXIBLE ACTIVE-SITE LOOP OPEN AND CLOSED. THIS INFORMATION WILL HELP STRENGTHEN THE COMPUTATIONAL MODELING, AND SUBSEQUENT COMPOUND DESIGN.  COVALENT INHIBITION OF ENZYMES BASED ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF A SET OF CYSTEINE TARGETING COVALENT WARHEADS INCLUDING ACRYLAMIDES, VINYL SULFONES AND NITRILES, HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE A SUCCESSFUL APPROACH IN DRUG DISCOVERY PIPELINES. IN OUR PROPOSAL, AN INITIAL SET OF PUTATIVE INHIBITORS THAT INCORPORATE AN ACRYLAMIDE WARHEAD HAVE ALREADY BEEN RATIONALLY DESIGNED TO TARGET THE TCDHODH ACTIVE-SITE CYSTEINE. PREDICTED INHIBITORS WILL BE EVALUATED FOR INHIBITORY POTENCY AND MECHANISM OF INHIBITION AGAINST TCDHODH, CYTOTOXICITY AND ITS ANTI-PARASITIC EFFECTS IN CELL CULTURE. X-RAY CRYSTALLOGRAPHY, FRAGMENT SCREENING AND MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY WILL BE COMBINED TO PROVIDE THE CHEMICAL BASIS FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF A NEW GENERATION OF POTENT, SELECTIVE, AND DRUG-LIKE INHIBITORS.
