TSE e Google firmam parceria para combater desinformação,
O Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE) oficializou nesta quinta-feira (1º) parceria com nove agências de checagem para criação da “Coalizão para Checagem - Eleições 2020”. Participam do projeto: AFP, Agência Lupa, Aos Fatos, Boatos.org, Comprova, E-Farsas, Estadão Verifica, Fato ou Fake e UOL Confere.

A rede de checagem de fatos e de fornecimento de informações sobre o processo eleitoral integra o Programa de Enfrentamento à Desinformação com Foco nas Eleições 2020.

Por meio da parceria, as agências, o TSE e integrantes dos Tribunais Regionais Eleitorais (TREs) estarão em contato permanente para identificar notícias falsas sobre as eleições e encontrar, da forma mais ágil possível, respostas verdadeiras e precisas.

As notícias checadas a partir desse grupo serão publicadas na página "Fato ou Boato", disponível no Portal da Justiça Eleitoral. A página também traz informações sobre o funcionamento da urna eletrônica e o processo eletrônico de votação e mais dados sobre checagem.

Por meio de parceria firmada com as operadoras de telefonia e o Conexis Brasil Digital, todos os sites do domínio da Justiça Eleitoral têm o chamado zero rating, ou seja, podem ser acessados sem cobrança ao pacote de dados do celular.

Papel da imprensa

Durante a cerimônia de formalização da Coalizão para Checagem, o presidente do TSE, ministro Luís Roberto Barroso, destacou o papel da imprensa e das agências de checagem para promover eleições limpas.

Segundo o ministro, a ideia é minimizar o impacto da desinformação nas campanhas eleitorais sem interferir no conteúdo dessas manifestações, ou seja, “monitorar comportamentos provenientes de milícias digitais organizadas com financiamento privado e atuação concentrada para a difusão de mentiras e ataques”.

Nesse sentido, o presidente da Corte lembrou que não existe um dono da verdade, mas “a mentira deliberada e a campanha de ódio têm dono, e essas nós devemos combater”.

De acordo com Barroso, é preciso inundar a sociedade com notícias verdadeiras, e esse é um papel fundamental exercido pela imprensa profissional. Dessa forma, será possível enfrentar as campanhas de desinformação, monitorar e eliminar os comportamentos inautênticos de robôs e perfis falsos. “O exercício da democracia depende da livre circulação de ideias, fatos e opiniões”, finalizou.

Participaram da formalização do acordo: Elodie Martinez, pela AFP; Natália Leal, pela Agência Lupa; Tai Nalon, pelo Aos Fatos; Edgard Matsuki, do Boatos.org; Sérgio Boeck, pelo Comprova; Marco Faustino, pelo E-Farsas; Daniel Bramatti, pelo Estadão Verifica; Thiago Reis, pelo Fato ou Fake; e Alexandre Gimenez, pelo UOL Confere. Cristina Tardaguila, da International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), participou como observadora da Coalização.

TSE renova parceria com agências de checa
Em cerimônia virtual realizada nesta terça-feira (22), o presidente do Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE), ministro Luís Roberto Barroso, deu mais um passo no combate à desinformação e em defesa da legitimidade das próximas eleições: a renovação do acordo entre a Corte Eleitoral e agências de checagem de informações. A parceria entre o Tribunal e profissionais da imprensa que atuam para desmentir boatos sobre o processo eleitoral ocorre desde 2020 e faz parte do Programa de Enfrentamento à Desinformação.

A chamada “Coalizão para Checagem – Eleições 2022” atuará com o objetivo de averiguar a veracidade de informações que circulam na internet, especialmente nas redes sociais, e que podem interferir de maneira negativa na escolha do eleitor na hora de votar.

De acordo com o ministro Barroso, desde o início da parceria com as agências de checagem até dezembro de 2020, foram publicadas 274 matérias, quantidade muito significativa de conteúdo, cujo levantamento só foi possível graças ao trabalho realizado pela parceria. “A melhor forma de combater desinformação é inundar o mercado com notícias verdadeiras, a checagem de notícias se tornou uma vertente importante do jornalismo profissional. Temos muita confiança e apreço por esse trabalho”, destacou.

Desafio

Ao enaltecer a parceria com as agências de checagem, o presidente do TSE afirmou que é importante reforçar os valores verdadeiros. “Devemos trabalhar para alertar as pessoas que uma causa que precisa de ódio, mentira e desinformação não pode ser uma causa boa”, ressaltou.

A secretária-geral da Corte, Aline Osório, salientou o papel de um ambiente informacional mais saudável. “É importante que a coalizão tenha se tornado permanente. Esta cerimônia de hoje marca essa nossa união e parceria, que é uma das maiores existentes entre organismos eleitorais no mundo. Esperamos que neste ano consigamos resultados ainda mais expressivos, sabemos que as eleições serão ainda mais desafiadoras”.

Agências parceiras

O evento foi transmitido ao vivo pelo canal do TSE no YouTube e contou com a participação de representantes dos seguintes veículos de comunicação: AFP, Agência Lupa, Aos Fatos, Boatos.org, Comprova, E-Farsas, Estadão Verifica, Fato ou Fake e UOL Confere.

Plano estratégico

O objetivo principal do Plano Estratégico a ser desenvolvido é combater os boatos com informações verdadeiras e de qualidade produzidas pela imprensa profissional. Por meio da parceria, as agências, o TSE e integrantes dos Tribunais Regionais Eleitorais (TREs) estarão em contato permanente para identificar notícias falsas sobre as eleições deste ano e elaborar, da forma mais ágil possível, respostas reais e precisas.

Para ampliar ainda mais o alcance dessas informações oficiais que serão produzidas, o TSE já firmou outra parceria com as principais plataformas digitais . Nesse contexto, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Twitter, Google, YouTube, TikTok e Kwai se comprometeram a utilizar os recursos tecnológicos que dispõem para divulgar fatos verídicos sobre o processo eleitoral, dando prioridade à divulgação de dados oficiais.

Além disso, estão previstas ações para capacitar a sociedade como um todo a compreender o fenômeno da desinformação e o funcionamento do processo eleitoral. Haverá, ainda, ações tanto preventivas quanto repressivas para conter os efeitos nocivos da desinformação.

Conforme o documento, a atuação da Justiça Eleitoral em parceria com a imprensa visa garantir o direito de eleitoras e eleitores de participar de eleições livres e justas com igualdade de oportunidades entre os diferentes candidatos, partidos e correntes políticas na disputa, a partir de um processo eleitoral legítimo, com higidez e credibilidade pública.

Acesse a íntegra do Plano Estratégico do TSE para combate à desinformação nas Eleições 2022 .

Enfrentamento Desinformação - 27.12.2021
A questão da disseminação da desinformação e os impactos dessa prática no processo democrático é um debate que tem ocupado a pauta de diversos países mundo afora. No Brasil não é diferente. E, nos últimos anos, o Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE) tem sido uma das instituições protagonistas no combate à ação de organizações que têm se dedicado a criar e espalhar boatos com o intuito de desacreditar a democracia, o Estado de Direito e os Poderes constituídos, bem como na promoção de ações de conscientização da sociedade sobre os perigos do compartilhamento de conteúdo falso ou descontextualizado.

O trabalho não se resume às paredes do Tribunal: ele envolve mais de 70 instituições públicas e privadas, que vêm somando esforços como parceiros do Programa de Enfrentamento à Desinformação ao trabalho de conter e neutralizar a propagação de conteúdos falsos e também cooperando para a construção de redes de sinergia que atuem de formas coordenadas nessa missão. O TSE conta hoje com a parceria de agências de checagem, plataformas de mídia social, empresas de telefonia, órgãos de pesquisa, organizações da sociedade civil, órgãos públicos e associações de mídia. E, para intensificar essa atuação conjunta, especialmente para as eleições do próximo ano, a Corte Eleitoral permanece aberta a novas alianças.

Entre as ações já desenvolvidas, estão projetos de destaque: a Coalizão para Checagem – Eleições 2020; a página Fato ou Boato; o desenvolvimento de um chatbot (robô) no WhatsApp para tirar dúvidas sobre o processo eleitoral, com quase 20 milhões de mensagens trocadas; a central de notificações nos aplicativos e-Título, Mesários e Pardal; o uso das hashtags #EuVotoSemFake, #NãoTransmitaFakeNews e #PartiuVotar; a campanha “Se For Fake News, Não Transmita”; e o banimento de contas que fizeram envio massivo de mensagens nas eleições.

Resultados e reconhecimento

Como reconhecimento da sociedade ao trabalho desenvolvido pelo TSE, o Programa de Enfrentamento à Desinformação foi premiado na categoria Tribunal do 18º Prêmio Innovare, anunciado no começo de dezembro. À frente da iniciativa desde a preparação das Eleições Municipais de 2020, a secretária-geral da Presidência do TSE, Aline Osorio, dedicou o prêmio a cada um dos mais de 60 parceiros, “que nos ajudaram a atuar, de forma eficaz, para reduzir o impacto negativo da desinformação”.

O Programa também recebeu o Prêmio Transparência e Fiscalização Pública 2021, entregue em dezembro ao presidente da Corte Eleitoral, ministro Luís Roberto Barroso, pela Comissão de Fiscalização Financeira e Controle, da Câmara dos Deputados.

Promovendo o debate e partilhando experiências

Em 2021, na esteira do processo de preparação para as Eleições Gerais de 2022, o TSE organizou em outubro o II Seminário Internacional Desinformação e Eleições, que promoveu o debate entre especialistas e representantes de instituições públicas do Brasil e do exterior e de entidades da sociedade civil, além de veículos de comunicação. A finalidade foi levantar formas de impedir ou minimizar a divulgação de informações falsas no pleito do ano que vem.

Em novembro, a desinformação também foi tema do congresso SNE 2: Direito Eleitoral e Democracia, que reuniu especialistas nacionais e de outros países para debater os estudos envolvendo a Sistematização das Normas Eleitorais no contexto dos Objetivos de Desenvolvimento Sustentável (ODS) da Agenda 2030 do programa das Nações Unidas para o Desenvolvimento (PNUD).

Os membros da Corte Eleitoral também participaram de diversos eventos realizados por outras instituições para discutir as ameaças da desinformação ao processo eleitoral democrático. Em março, por exemplo, o ministro Luís Roberto Barroso participou virtualmente como convidado do Ciclo Eleitoral da Democracia Digital 2021, realizado em Lima, no Peru.

Em junho, durante a viagem ao México para acompanhar as eleições locais como observador convidado, Barroso defendeu respostas imediatas e veementes aos conteúdos falsos durante o evento “Processo eleitoral federal e os processos eleitorais locais concorrentes 2020-2021”, promovido pelo Instituto Nacional Eleitoral (INE). Em novembro, ele integrou o debate virtual “Fake News and Elections: how to reduce the threat” durante encontro realizado pela Americas Quarterly, publicação ligada à organização internacional Americas Society/Council of Americas (AS/COA).

E, em dezembro, o presidente do TSE participou do encontro “Eleições e a transformação digital”, promovido pelo Consórcio para Eleições e Fortalecimento do Processo Político (CEPPS) e pela Agência dos Estados Unidos para o Desenvolvimento Internacional (Usaid).

Outras instituições

No início de 2021, o Colégio de Presidentes dos Tribunais Regionais Eleitorais (Coptrel) e o TSE promoveram o Seminário “Transformações na Comunicação: Novos Paradigmas Pós-Pandemia”, que contou com a presença da equipe da Secretaria de Comunicação da Corte Eleitoral. O Tribunal ainda participou, como exemplo de trabalho a ser replicado em outros países, do Guia de Combate à Desinformação, elaborado pelo Consórcio para Eleições e Fortalecimento do Processo Político (CEPPS) e lançado em maio passado.

Em junho, foi a vez de a secretária-geral do TSE, Aline Osorio, falar sobre os principais desafios dos processos eleitorais relacionados ao surgimento de notícias falsas e à tentativa de enfraquecer as instituições eleitorais, em um webinar promovido pela União Europeia em parceria com a Agência EFE Brasil. E, em agosto, o Conselho Nacional Eleitoral (CNE) do Equador promoveu o encontro “O impacto da pandemia e das notícias falsas nos processos eleitorais”, que contou com o assessor-chefe para Assuntos Internacionais e Cerimonial do TSE, José Gilberto Scandiucci Filho.

Por fim, em outubro, a secretária de Comunicação Social da Corte Eleitoral, Giselly Siqueira, participou do painel “Comunicação Institucional e o Combate à desinformação” do II Seminário On-line de Comunicação & Justiça – Comunicando direitos e cidadania em tempos excepcionais. O evento foi organizado pelo Fórum Nacional de Comunicação e Justiça, entidade sem fins lucrativos composta por profissionais de comunicação que atuam em órgãos do Judiciário, Ministérios Públicos, Defensorias Públicas, Tribunais de Contas e instituições afins.

TSE integra estudo internacional contra a desinformação

TSE integra estudo internacional contra a desinformação - 11.05.2021
Tendo em vista o desafio que a desinformação representa à democracia no mundo todo, o Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE) vem criando ferramentas e promovendo iniciativas que visam tornar as eleições cada vez mais legítimas, transparentes e seguras. Nesse sentido, a Corte participou, como exemplo de trabalho a ser replicado em outros países, do Guia de Combate à Desinformação, elaborado pelo Consórcio para Eleições e Fortalecimento do Processo Político (CEPPS). 

A publicação é uma união global de medidas exitosas pelo enfrentamento do problema e pelo incentivo à integridade da informação, sendo direcionada a profissionais, sociedade civil e órgãos governamentais que trabalham com essa questão.

Na cerimônia de lançamento do estudo, no dia 28 de abril, o TSE foi representado pelo assessor-chefe de Assuntos Internacionais e Cerimonial (AIC), José Gilberto Scandiucci Filho, que respondeu à Lisa Reppell, da Fundação Internacional para Sistemas Eleitorais (IFES), sobre as práticas mais inovadoras e impactantes do Tribunal nessa área.

Ele informou que, em 2020, ano em que foram realizadas eleições no Brasil, o Tribunal estabeleceu uma força-tarefa multissetorial para o combate à desinformação, com a participação de plataformas sociais, mídia tradicional, sociedade civil e governos locais. A ideia era responder de forma rápida e ágil às ameaças sofridas nesse período. 

Parceria

Foram firmadas parcerias com o WhatsApp e outras redes sociais para que a busca a tais ameaças fosse rápida e eficiente. Segundo Scandiucci, outra prática foi a elaboração de acordos e memorandos de entendimento com essas plataformas para incluir, em suas políticas internas, medidas concretas para enfrentar o problema.

“Por exemplo, com o WhatsApp, criamos um formulário on-line, onde os cidadãos pudessem reportar casos de mensagens em massa, para que a plataforma pudesse iniciar uma investigação interna, o que poderia acarretar o banimento de contas responsáveis. Recebemos mais de cinco mil denúncias de mensagens ilegais em massa e mais de mil contas foram banidas”, informou.

Ao mencionar técnicas que podem ser replicadas em outros países, o representante do TSE revelou que, além dessa comunicação, é essencial a criação de um grupo de funcionários permanentemente dedicados a esse propósito, sempre em contato direto com a autoridade máxima de cada órgão. “Aqui, tudo foi feito a partir do gabinete do presidente, a quem essa equipe deveria reportar diretamente. Isso torna o processo mais ágil e evita a burocracia”, concluiu.

No Guia, as experiências brasileiras são destacadas especialmente no tópico Comunicação Estratégica e Educação Eleitoral para Mitigar Ameaças de Desinformação. “Queremos evitar a disseminação de notícias falsas, não com o controle de conteúdo, mas com esclarecimento, consciência crítica e informação de qualidade”, disse o presidente do TSE, ministro Luís Roberto Barroso, em depoimento ao estudo.

O CEPPS

O Consórcio é um acordo cooperativo supervisionado pela Agência dos Estados Unidos para o Desenvolvimento Internacional (USAID) e inclui o Instituto Republicano Internacional (IRI), a Fundação Internacional para Sistemas Eleitorais (IFES) e o Instituto Nacional Democrático para Assuntos Internacionais.

O lançamento virtual também contou com a participação do diretor técnico do CEPPS, Jerry Lavery; David Black (USAID); Daniel Arnaudo (NDI); Brett Barrowman (IRI); Olga Aivazovska (Network OPORA – Ucrânia); Sabrine Ghoubantini (Foundation IMF - Tunísia); César Castro Fagoaga (Revista Factum - El Salvador) e das moderadoras Kat Duffy (Internews) e Vera Zakem (Zakem Global Strategies).

3:53 - about the impact of digital

4:04 - counteringdisinformation.org
4:07 - this is a resource steps developed this
4:09 - year to provide a one-stop shop and
4:10 - learning what resources we have around

4:17 - regulatory frameworks around information
4:19 - and elections um transparency and
4:22 - accountability initiatives online and
4:24 - the like um
4:25 - the great part of this about this tool
4:27 - is that it's multilingual um and forever
4:30 - expanding we want to know what you're
4:32 - working on and you can submit your
4:34 - interventions there
4:36 - um i wanted to make a few kind of key
4:38 - points before we dive in today um the
4:40 - first of which is that no two elections
4:42 - are alike uh no information space is the
4:45 - same as another however we do know that
4:48 - there are some kind of common trends and
4:50 - shared experiences that we might see
4:52 - across national and regional divides
4:55 - and this exchange can help us learn from
4:56 - one another so we hope that you all will
4:59 - freely share your perspectives with us
5:00 - today so we can kind of collectively
5:03 - work together to move this conversation
5:05 - forward
5:07 - it's also important to address the
5:09 - urgency of of this problem
5:11 - democratic elections rely on a
5:13 - competitive process on faith in
5:16 - electoral institutions
5:18 - and on informed participation
5:20 - however the deployment of false
5:22 - manipulated or disorienting information
5:26 - in the electoral environment has been
5:28 - used to undermine these principles and
5:30 - countries across the globe amplifying
5:32 - voter confusion
5:34 - galvanizing social cleavages suppressing
5:37 - the participation of women in
5:38 - marginalized groups and degrading trust
5:40 - in democratic institutions and in some
5:42 - cases electoral outcomes themselves
5:45 - while disinformation campaigns around
5:47 - elections are not new
5:49 - advances in digital technology means
5:51 - that they are significantly more
5:53 - effective reaching unprecedented speeds
5:56 - distances and volumes
5:58 - than previous cycles
6:00 - meanwhile there are main few
6:02 - disincentives to dissuade political
6:05 - contestants or governments from engaging
6:06 - with disinformation
6:08 - at the same time we are increasingly
6:10 - seeing seeing the combined efforts of
6:12 - civil society and government overcome
6:14 - digital threats and allow space for
6:16 - voters to have their voices heard in
6:18 - zambia recently nonpartisan citizen
6:21 - election observers and fact checkers
6:22 - helped build confidence in the electoral
6:24 - outcome that ultimately saw a peaceful
6:26 - transition of power uh in places like
6:28 - kosovo and our media election
6:30 - commissions and journalists and others
6:32 - monitored and anticipated disinformation
6:34 - threats ahead of elections and built
6:36 - resilient strategies to help safeguard
6:38 - the process
6:40 - those working to support democracy are
6:42 - adapting to a new environment shaped by
6:44 - digital by digital transformation which
6:47 - includes new and often transnational
6:50 - actors like tech companies and
6:53 - pr consultants and others
6:55 - and threat drivers that often have less
6:57 - transparency in the online space and
6:59 - also means shifting and expanding
7:01 - timelines and skill sets to meet
7:03 - evolving tactics
7:05 - while we are in some cases confronting
7:07 - disinformation and other digital threats
7:09 - to elections head on more fundamentally
7:11 - we must find ways to build and promote
7:13 - information integrity as a core tenant
7:15 - of open credible and democratic
7:17 - political systems as alex mentioned seps

9:34 - rights issues and in the clinton
9:35 - administration as deputy to the u.s
9:37 - ambassador for you and management and
9:38 - reform
9:39 - as you can see our panelists represent
9:41 - three different and important
9:42 - perspectives one from an election
9:44 - management body uh one from civil
9:47 - society working around elections and the
9:50 - third from human rights and social media
9:52 - accountability in the context of
9:53 - elections
9:54 - so thank you very much for joining us
9:57 - um i'd like to just go ahead and get
9:58 - started um justice rosso i'll start with
10:01 - you um if you could just set the scene
10:04 - for us um over the past decade
10:07 - how have social media platforms and
10:09 - online engagement change the way that we
10:11 - approach elections um give us your
10:14 - perspective from what you've experienced
10:15 - and had to address
10:17 - in brazil
10:22 - thank you uh julia it's a pleasure to be
10:24 - here and meet you all all the online uh
10:27 - suzanne
10:29 - ian
10:30 - and
10:32 - you know share some reflections on
10:35 - these major changes i would say that the
10:37 - digital or technological revolution
10:40 - has brought to our lives it has changed
10:43 - the way
10:45 - we do a research the way we travel the
10:47 - way we listen
10:49 - to music
10:50 - and one of the main products of the
10:53 - technology technological revolution
10:56 - has been the rise
10:58 - of social media and when i say social
11:01 - media i mean
11:02 - uh facebook instagram
11:05 - um
11:07 - youtube even
11:09 - uh
11:10 - messaging
11:12 - apps like uh
11:14 - whatsapp and twitter
11:17 - this has
11:18 - changed
11:20 - the way
11:21 - uh social and interpersonal
11:23 - communication is uh is carried out
11:27 - and i think it has a
11:30 - very good side that we can emphasize
11:34 - which is
11:35 - uh democratizing access to information
11:39 - and and to knowledge and i think this is
11:41 - pretty good
11:43 - but on the other hand
11:45 - the social media has to a certain extent
11:48 - bypass the role that professional press
11:52 - would play
11:53 - in
11:54 - screening what was
11:56 - being conveyed the opinions the ideas
11:59 - the information
12:01 - so
12:02 - these days
12:03 - anyone
12:04 - can talk to the world we are not
12:07 - disputing any more
12:09 - uh space
12:10 - in in
12:12 - in outlets but we are disputing
12:14 - attention of people that that's
12:16 - uh the the scenario
12:19 - and the the social media has become
12:22 - increasingly important like in brazil
12:24 - for example
12:26 - whatsapp
12:27 - is responsible for 78
12:30 - of the information people get
12:33 - television comes second with 50
12:36 - what happened in brazil
12:39 - to give you a particular scenario of
12:41 - what happened here
12:43 - was that in
12:44 - 2018
12:46 - as usual
12:47 - the candidates were disputing
12:50 - television and radio
12:53 - time in in brazil candidates have
12:56 - assigned to them for free television and
12:59 - radio time and alliances are built to
13:02 - get more television time
13:04 - so as usual the candidates were doing
13:07 - that in 2018
13:09 - and what happened here julia was that
13:12 - the candidate
13:14 - that made
13:15 - a incredible number of alliances to get
13:18 - a huge time of television
13:20 - placed forth
13:22 - because the winning candidate which was
13:25 - bolsonaro
13:27 - uh
13:28 - used for the first time in brazilian
13:30 - elections uh extensively social media
13:34 - with both messages and reaching
13:37 - a
13:38 - much higher number of people i think
13:41 - this is
13:42 - uh
13:43 - something that i would like to point out
13:46 - and we learned a lot how to deal
13:49 - with social media with this information
13:51 - with hate speech with
13:54 - messaging from 2018
13:57 - and of course in 2020 things went much
14:00 - much better uh although we still had
14:03 - problems so uh
14:06 - just to sum up what i'm saying
14:08 - uh at least
14:10 - for the 2020 elections and 2018 social
14:14 - media played a very important role for
14:18 - good and for bad we could talk about
14:20 - that uh later on but as julius said at
14:23 - the beginning
14:25 - no two elections are alike
14:28 - so i cannot promise
14:30 - that it's going to be the same in this
14:32 - common elections in in 2022
14:36 - especially because
14:38 - the electoral authorities learned a lot
14:41 - how to deal and how to fight
14:44 - misinformation
14:46 - and especially regarding the electoral
14:49 - uh authorities but we're going to be
14:52 - tough on bulk messaging and on hate
14:55 - speech
14:56 - on on on the social media so i think we
14:59 - are all learning but one thing we can
15:02 - state
15:03 - for a fact is that social media has
15:05 - completely changed the way elections are
15:08 - played probably all over the world i
15:11 - think that's uh what i would say julia
15:14 - as a starter of our conversation
15:19 - thank you very much um diane i wanted to
15:22 - turn to you um
15:24 - you know what have you seen change in
15:26 - terms of voters and civil society groups
15:28 - you know how have you all adjusted both
15:31 - in positive ways when it comes to
15:34 - you know uh the democratization of
15:37 - information as as justice barroso put it
15:40 - um in terms of outreach but also um
15:44 - trying to to mitigate the negatives in
15:46 - terms of disinformation
15:51 - well thank you very much julia i think
15:53 - it's been interesting and in africa we
15:55 - continue to say that
15:57 - while social media has its negatives
16:00 - it's also been positive in the sense
16:03 - that it has democratized
16:05 - um
16:05 - [Music]
16:06 - information and most importantly put
16:09 - powers in the hands of the people and
16:11 - when you look at social media really for
16:13 - us even as groups as civil society
16:15 - groups is a very important tool
16:18 - during elections in terms of organizing
16:21 - in terms of training in terms of voter
16:23 - education
16:25 - as well we use it for a lot of things in
16:28 - fact trainings are conducted over
16:31 - uh whatsapp or telegram uh especially
16:34 - with the kovid um 19 funding will be
16:38 - that as it may the other negative aspect
16:41 - is the disinformation itself and even
16:43 - data-driven influence um operation in
16:47 - elections and for us it's important that
16:50 - this information is nothing new it's
16:52 - always been there
16:54 - but the difference is the speed
16:57 - the reach and of course the low cost
17:00 - because previously people will go on
17:01 - foot from villages to villages we call
17:04 - them radio without battery to spread
17:06 - false information but now you can put
17:09 - something on social media and it reaches
17:12 - everywhere and it's also extremely cheap
17:15 - you can hide in a room
17:17 - and say things and i think this
17:19 - important thing is that it has it's
17:22 - affecting how people participate in the
17:25 - whole democratic process itself aside
17:27 - health outcome
17:30 - and it has changed our elections
17:32 - is run by both the election management
17:35 - bodies and the civil society
17:37 - organizations so previously you just
17:40 - have to go to the polling unit you
17:41 - follow all the processes that leads to
17:44 - the elections physically but now you
17:46 - have to concentrate on the information
17:49 - space the information phase itself where
17:52 - of course we are seeing a lot of things
17:55 - how this information has been used to
17:57 - lower turnout
17:59 - voters
18:01 - in many countries you find once there is
18:03 - a second round you find two candidates
18:05 - on different
18:07 - ballots and people do not even know who
18:09 - to vote for for voter suppression
18:12 - and ignites post-election violence and i
18:15 - think for me the what i would refer to
18:17 - to give a vivid example is just the
18:19 - concluded uh gambian elections which
18:22 - held just saturday and on sunday the
18:25 - result was announced but unfortunately
18:27 - yesterday we were just there and we got
18:30 - news that on the facebook page of the
18:33 - three years josna they published a
18:35 - different report result and they showed
18:38 - that in that result
18:39 - the
18:40 - udp candidates actually had more than
18:43 - 300 thousand over 243 000 votes as
18:47 - against the incubate president of the
18:49 - mpp and immediately that
18:52 - circulated
18:54 - previously there was jubilation by the
18:56 - winner immediately
18:59 - young people in support of the udp
19:02 - moved right there onto the street of
19:04 - banjo
19:06 - and from jubilation we saw
19:09 - the election get test unfortunately
19:12 - violence averted and this is the kind of
19:16 - challenges
19:17 - we have
19:18 - with this information
19:20 - in elections now in the difficulty again
19:23 - is not even in terms of the law
19:26 - enforcement approach it's also the
19:28 - multiplicity of strategies that have
19:31 - been utilized
19:33 - again
19:34 - is not before we talk about
19:35 - computational propaganda you talk again
19:38 - about more than 11 different strategies
19:41 - at different points in time people keep
19:43 - getting better
19:44 - and in the african context where the
19:47 - online and the offline structure each
19:50 - other it becomes extremely difficult
19:55 - where there are very little capacity
19:58 - and there is a less money
20:01 - also being
20:03 - pushed into
20:04 - the addressing information disorder
20:09 - and more legislation or platforms and
20:12 - again i think another challenge to put
20:14 - out which makes it very difficult is
20:16 - that the the corporation accorded
20:18 - nigeria by facebook or meta now and
20:22 - twitter will not be the same
20:24 - in
20:26 - gambia in the gambia or completely
20:29 - non-existent in cape verde
20:31 - all in the same west africa
20:34 - now it has shown that
20:36 - elections can actually be won
20:39 - using this information
20:41 - and other data-driven mechanisms
20:45 - beyond violence or even vote buying it's
20:49 - become a very important two kids
20:52 - in
20:54 - and elections and the capacity are
20:56 - likely not there in terms of addressing
20:59 - it thank
21:00 - you thank you diet and you definitely
21:04 - pointed out some submissions issues i
21:06 - know we've all been struggling with
21:07 - especially related to
21:08 - uh disinformation around uh electoral
21:11 - outcomes right and election results um i
21:14 - did want to pass it on to um
21:17 - to suzanne also uh especially related to
21:20 - when we're kind of talking about the 30
21:22 - 000 foot problem
21:23 - um i'd be interested to to get
21:26 - your perspective from the sort of the
21:29 - two hats that you wear one as a human
21:31 - rights defender uh and your role at pen
21:33 - america but also um this
21:36 - this sort of new phenomenon we have um
21:38 - of platform accountability and your role
21:41 - at uh the oversight board yeah sure well
21:45 - thanks so much for convening this
21:46 - discussion um and it's great to be here
21:49 - you know uh i mean from our perspective
21:52 - at penn america
21:53 - we recognized about five years ago the
21:57 - disinformation even though it's
21:59 - overwhelmingly
22:01 - protected by the first amendment and by
22:04 - international
22:05 - legal safeguards for freedom of
22:07 - expression that it nonetheless
22:09 - poses a threat to open discourse and can
22:13 - undercut democracy and we
22:15 - did a whole analysis of
22:18 - why that was and the ways in which
22:20 - disinformation can
22:22 - corrode citizen engagement
22:25 - trust in the media the media's ability
22:27 - to carry out
22:29 - its function as a force for democratic
22:31 - accountability
22:33 - undermining fact and evidence-based
22:37 - policy making
22:39 - distorting discourse through the uh
22:43 - opaque engagement of foreign actors uh
22:46 - and and uh people motivated by pecuniary
22:49 - interests that are
22:51 - hidden from view and and we kind of uh
22:54 - sent up an alarm bell worrying about
22:56 - sort of a plague of cynicism
22:59 - and rising authoritarianism that we
23:02 - thought could ensue if disinformation
23:04 - was allowed to continue to
23:07 - course freely through our society and i
23:08 - would say over the ensuing years here in
23:10 - the united states it really feels like i
23:12 - was i was looking back on this
23:14 - introductory essay that i wrote uh about
23:16 - four and a half years ago and it feels
23:18 - like a lot of that has really
23:20 - come to fruition we also i also worried
23:23 - about our ability to respond effectively
23:26 - to national emergencies including
23:28 - health-related emergencies and we've
23:29 - obviously seen how disinformation has
23:33 - stood in the way of that uh the thing is
23:35 - the solutions are not simple and i'm
23:37 - glad that the other uh that luis and uh
23:40 - idaya talked about the the positives of
23:43 - social media because that's a lot of
23:45 - what makes this so complex is that
23:47 - social media is in some ways a great
23:49 - enabler of democracy and we see that
23:53 - here in this country and around the
23:55 - world and the
23:58 - task which in some ways is what we're
23:59 - trying to do at the oversight board to
24:02 - kind of perform the surgery where you
24:04 - perf you preserve
24:06 - that which is good and valuable uh about
24:09 - social media while trying to excise what
24:13 - seems to be most harmful you know turns
24:15 - out to be
24:17 - really difficult line drawing and there
24:20 - there's not a lot of principle to go on
24:22 - we're guided by uh international human
24:24 - rights law by facebook's own
24:27 - stated principles but uh there's a lot
24:30 - of gray area and in in election related
24:34 - uh misinformation you know i'd say
24:35 - particularly i mean first of all
24:38 - we have to distinguish between
24:40 - process-related information the kinds of
24:42 - things that i think we're mostly talking
24:44 - about on this panel about
24:46 - how an election is going to be run where
24:49 - and when you can vote how the votes will
24:51 - be counted uh when the election will be
24:53 - certified and all of that is becoming
24:56 - more complicated because of the
24:58 - digitization of the process it's become
25:00 - more complicated in the climate of covid
25:03 - where here in this country mail-in
25:04 - voting has become uh far more
25:07 - commonplace than
25:08 - ever before uh you know there are now
25:11 - all kinds of rule changes that are being
25:13 - enacted at the state level here in the
25:15 - united states so things that people are
25:17 - accustomed to
25:18 - uh in the past are no longer operate the
25:21 - way they once did and that all provides
25:23 - very fertile ground for
25:26 - disinformation uh you know what i think
25:28 - there are some lessons we can learn from
25:31 - the more aggressive approach that
25:32 - platforms have taken uh to
25:34 - disinformation in the covid context uh
25:37 - being more assertive in terms of
25:39 - removals and also uh pushing up
25:43 - credible authoritative sources of
25:45 - information from whether it's the cdc or
25:47 - the who you know there's an equivalent
25:49 - to that in the election context which
25:51 - began here in the united states in 2020
25:54 - uh and i think it will accelerate in
25:56 - terms of directing anybody who queries
25:59 - an election related
26:00 - question on on twitter on facebook to
26:04 - those authoritative sources i don't know
26:06 - what degree that's happening around the
26:07 - world one of the startling revelations
26:10 - uh from the facebook whistleblower
26:12 - francis hogan was just
26:14 - uh the the order of magnitude by which
26:17 - content moderation
26:18 - resources are skewed toward the united
26:21 - states for all of the problems that we
26:22 - have here in this country
26:24 - uh we're vastly better served by uh more
26:27 - targeted and proactive approaches to
26:30 - dealing with disinformation uh on
26:32 - facebook than our uh is the rest of the
26:34 - world and so i think that's why you see
26:36 - situations like the one that india
26:38 - described uh just having taken place uh
26:41 - in in gambia
26:43 - you know there's also the area of it's
26:45 - more um more gray candidates policy
26:49 - positions and even their personal lives
26:51 - uh being the subject of disinformation
26:53 - this you know this is where it sort of
26:55 - gets into core political speech which is
26:57 - the type of speech that under the first
26:58 - amendment
26:59 - is uh you know the most stringently
27:03 - protected because it is part of uh you
27:05 - know the function of a deliberative
27:07 - democracy to be able to talk about
27:08 - somebody's policy positions their
27:10 - character their integrity you know and
27:13 - we've always had uh i'd say a a a blurry
27:18 - boundary line in negative campaigning
27:20 - between
27:21 - uh you know what is simply the rough and
27:23 - tumble of a hard-fought contest and what
27:26 - crosses the line
27:28 - into uh disinformation and and you know
27:31 - that's no easier to resolve on
27:34 - social media
27:36 - uh i'll just throw out a few other
27:38 - issues that maybe we want to take up for
27:40 - more discussion that i think kind of
27:42 - complicate the problem on social media
27:45 - and one of course that we haven't really
27:47 - talked about is algorithmic
27:48 - amplification and the ways in which the
27:50 - most incendiary and outrageous claims
27:54 - travel the furthest uh and the farthest
27:56 - and that's the nature of social media
27:58 - it's also what makes social media work
28:01 - as a political tool it's because you can
28:03 - get people excited about a candidate
28:05 - because those very same algorithms play
28:07 - off people's emotions and engagement and
28:11 - so you know that surgery of trying to
28:13 - draw a line between uh you know positive
28:17 - and healthy uses of that virality and
28:19 - those that are dangerous uh is difficult
28:22 - you know questions of whether to apply
28:24 - the same rules uh that operate for
28:27 - ordinary social media platform users to
28:30 - candidates for office and officials and
28:32 - obviously we can talk more about uh the
28:34 - donald trump case which was decided by
28:36 - the oversight board it was actually
28:38 - before
28:39 - i joined the board uh but i'd written
28:42 - about that topic before joining and uh
28:45 - you know it obviously raised some very
28:46 - thorny issues
28:48 - questions of anonymity and as a human
28:50 - rights uh defender i'm very cognizant of
28:53 - the uses and necessity of anonymity
28:56 - on social media uh in terms of its its
28:59 - utility as a a vehicle for exposing
29:03 - human rights abuses but in the election
29:05 - context obviously special issues are
29:07 - raised you can have legitimate factual
29:10 - information that is propagated and
29:13 - amplified by somebody whose motives are
29:17 - hidden you know and you may think it's a
29:19 - local civic organization it's actually
29:21 - the russian government that's pointed
29:23 - you know bringing you this story uh
29:25 - about hillary clinton's financial
29:27 - dealings for example and so that makes a
29:30 - big difference and uh really complicates
29:33 - the calculation in terms of anonymity i
29:35 - i personally believe particularly when
29:36 - it comes to paid postings that uh
29:39 - the you know some of the steps that have
29:41 - been taken to foster transparency i
29:43 - think are are important and need to be
29:45 - built upon
29:46 - yeah you also have these kind of very
29:48 - gray
29:49 - areas things like distorted yeah there
29:51 - was a famous uh
29:53 - viral video
29:54 - of nancy pelosi that had been sort of
29:56 - slowed down so it sounded as if she was
29:58 - slurring her words and kind of losing
30:00 - her faculties and there was a big debate
30:02 - about whether that
30:03 - crossed a line was that priority was
30:06 - that satire uh was that disinformation
30:09 - and shouldn't have a place uh
30:12 - on a platform and so uh you know these
30:14 - questions are not uh easily answered and
30:18 - you know what is i think important is
30:20 - that the social media companies are to a
30:23 - greater degree having their feet held to
30:25 - the fire and i think it's extremely
30:27 - important not just uh here in the u.s
30:29 - but around the world to be pointing out
30:32 - what kinds of information are spreading
30:34 - you know we as an oversight board are
30:35 - very interested in uh what's going on in
30:39 - tough cases in uh instances that would
30:42 - seem to
30:43 - violate uh facebook's rules and
30:45 - standards for
30:47 - to fly in the face of international
30:48 - human rights law we we examine those
30:50 - cases and sometimes they're very
30:52 - difficult uh but you know i think the
30:55 - more we can expose and and explicate the
30:58 - better
31:02 - thank you uh no this has been a great uh
31:05 - setup so we've talked about some of the
31:08 - good aspects um of social media and
31:10 - democracy
31:12 - um but also these sort of overwhelming
31:13 - challenges um that we're seeing related
31:16 - to disinformation and other kinds of uh
31:19 - information manipulation online
31:21 - before we get too discouraged i wanted
31:24 - to talk with you all about what works
31:26 - um what what how what have you been
31:28 - doing that you think is actually really
31:30 - kind of improving the information space
31:33 - um
31:34 - and i think maybe a diet i would like to
31:36 - start with you
31:38 - um i know you know one of the
31:40 - greatest strengths that we've seen
31:42 - around this issue has been civil society
31:44 - um really taking the reins and working
31:46 - to develop uh the information space that
31:49 - they want to see
31:50 - around elections um so i wanted to ask
31:53 - you if you could talk a little bit about
31:54 - your work um with cdd
31:57 - um you know
31:59 - especially in terms of building
32:01 - accountability
32:02 - um around uh disinformation in elections
32:06 - um how have you been able to sort of use
32:08 - your monitoring efforts because i know
32:10 - that you all have been doing kind of
32:11 - fact checking and media monitoring
32:13 - around elections um how have those been
32:16 - successful and how have you been using
32:18 - those efforts to sort of hold
32:19 - institutions candidates and platforms
32:21 - accountable
32:24 - well thank you very much um julia i
32:26 - think what we have learned and the the
32:29 - most important lesson really is
32:31 - collaboration
32:32 - and i think with collaboration we at the
32:35 - cdd have been able to achieve a lot so
32:37 - if you look at the just concluded gambia
32:39 - elections
32:40 - we've been working with three local
32:43 - civil society in gambia and together we
32:46 - formed our election analysis center for
32:49 - these elections and it was jointly owned
32:52 - by these people it gave legitimacy to
32:55 - the process because it was by gambia
32:58 - with cdd hiding behind them in terms of
33:01 - technical capacity
33:03 - and they were already working
33:05 - at every point in time and i think this
33:07 - collaboration has been the most
33:09 - important takeaway because when we talk
33:12 - about collaboration and the info
33:13 - integrity network which most of us
33:15 - belong to um being run by india and
33:18 - other partners is also a very good
33:21 - example in terms of holding other
33:24 - people's hand so i'll look at our first
33:26 - work with ndi which has to do with
33:28 - automation and we saw that with the
33:31 - support they gave us we saw the
33:32 - importance
33:34 - of adding
33:35 - that
33:36 - to our own qualitative analysis
33:39 - to show more
33:40 - really so i think our collaboration is
33:43 - something that works and works and works
33:46 - and another collaborative effort we have
33:48 - put particularly in elections is working
33:50 - with media houses so as a collective
33:54 - we jointly monitor the elections and we
33:56 - use their own platform to put out the
33:58 - information in terms of the reach they
34:01 - have
34:02 - both online
34:04 - and also the which they have on
34:06 - platforms such as telegram and
34:10 - whatsapp
34:11 - and their ability to immediately be act
34:14 - and this partnership also prevents them
34:16 - from engaging in partisan interest
34:22 - in partisan interest so it means that we
34:24 - jointly agree on the news we do our fact
34:26 - check we monitor the elections and we
34:28 - ensure that the right information
34:30 - actually goes into the public fair
34:33 - and again talking about partnership
34:35 - which i've seen of collaboration to be
34:37 - very big is working with government
34:39 - itself
34:40 - so most times governments feel like we
34:42 - have an
34:43 - impasse in nigeria currently where of
34:46 - course twitter has been banned and the
34:48 - nigerian government is at all holds in
34:51 - terms of engaging twitter and engaging
34:53 - with other platforms without having the
34:55 - correct information
34:57 - at their own fingertips or even knowing
35:00 - what they ask should actually be
35:02 - beyond saying that this platform has
35:05 - utilized to spread this information
35:08 - in terms of supplying them with evidence
35:10 - showing that these are the better ways
35:12 - that could actually be used i think that
35:15 - helps a lot and also partnering to train
35:18 - their own fat checkers even if we would
35:20 - never take away state-driven
35:22 - disinformation
35:24 - from this whole process i think is
35:27 - important then research research
35:29 - research it is i think research has
35:31 - driven our work like i gave the example
35:34 - of the first use of automation to gather
35:36 - information online from that we were
35:39 - able to see that there was 19 19.5
35:42 - automation in all the over 33 million
35:46 - tweets we aggregated
35:48 - and our response went through that and
35:51 - with the work we are doing with the
35:52 - world bank now they've been able to
35:54 - identify over one million urls spreading
35:57 - this information
35:59 - online so these kind of things do work
36:02 - then fact checking in local languages i
36:04 - think is also very important
36:07 - and picking out the bad apple and
36:09 - reporting them
36:10 - to the platform also works it works
36:13 - because we are able to monitor at the
36:16 - end of the day that we have in we have
36:18 - reported hundred
36:20 - handles and out of these old hundred
36:23 - handles it's only
36:24 - 10 percent that has been taken off so
36:27 - what exactly
36:28 - is the platform actually doing in terms
36:31 - of accountability
36:32 - their naming and shaming is being useful
36:36 - also so at first when we first check we
36:39 - go without mentioning the name of the
36:41 - party that is actually responsible then
36:44 - we discover that because of that they
36:46 - put their face into most of these
36:48 - messages but we do not put our faces to
36:51 - it so resonance with the people becomes
36:54 - very difficult then we mentioned their
36:56 - twitter hundred during elections and
36:58 - said that it is party a party b who has
37:00 - brought this and this is actually a fake
37:03 - claim and when we do our uh election day
37:06 - activity and post election we also do an
37:09 - analysis of the numbers of fake news
37:11 - that emanated from each of the party and
37:13 - of course the media carries it they do
37:15 - not like it
37:16 - but again it is making them to work as
37:19 - well as ensuring that they sign parts
37:22 - not to use fake news
37:25 - during elections i think these are some
37:27 - of the ways that we have worked but
37:29 - importantly research has proven very
37:31 - useful in terms of the response to
37:34 - utilize in terms of countering fake news
37:37 - aside from digital literacy which can
37:40 - never be enough or fact-checking in
37:43 - spite of its challenges and making it
37:46 - down to local languages which has been
37:48 - very very useful
37:50 - and quality journalism as responses
37:55 - thank you that was uh
37:57 - there's a lot of good recommendations
37:59 - there and i i really like
38:01 - talking about building accountability
38:03 - around kind of problematic actors um i
38:06 - think we we tend to focus a lot on
38:08 - content
38:09 - um when we're talking about
38:11 - um you know social media and
38:13 - disinformation
38:14 - when what we you know
38:17 - we can actually get a lot more bang for
38:18 - our buck if we're talking about building
38:20 - accountability right around repeat
38:22 - offenders um who are
38:24 - oftentimes the ones who are generating
38:26 - large um
38:28 - large portions of disinformation um
38:31 - uh i did want to turn it to uh justice
38:34 - brosso um diet mentioned collaboration
38:37 - um how helpful are technology platforms
38:40 - to you um at the at the tse in creating
38:43 - an environment that um that supports you
38:47 - know open and informed elections um is
38:49 - it constructive uh are there other
38:52 - partnerships or strategies that you rely
38:54 - on um to to kind of confront this issue
38:57 - that's been successful
39:02 - uh thank you julia well uh the platforms
39:05 - uh sometimes they're part of the
39:06 - solution sometimes they're part of the
39:08 - problem so uh we need to sort out things
39:11 - uh here one one interesting thing to
39:13 - point out uh julia and and everyone is
39:17 - that at the beginning of the internet
39:19 - and i'm i've been around for quite a
39:21 - while the main discourse was it must be
39:25 - it should be free
39:27 - open
39:28 - and unregulated that was
39:31 - the basic discourse that we would
39:34 - hear
39:35 - and we didn't
39:36 - listen to it for some time
39:39 - and i think the perceptions have changed
39:42 - entirely
39:43 - and you need to regulate the internet
39:46 - and social media for economic purposes
39:48 - because you need to apply anti-trust
39:51 - legislation you need to protect
39:52 - copyright
39:54 - uh
39:54 - you you
39:56 - uh you you need to have fair taxation
40:00 - then you have to regulate to protect
40:02 - privacy and most countries are uh
40:04 - enacting legislation to protect privacy
40:07 - and
40:08 - and this is more delicate
40:11 - you need to regulate
40:13 - on authentic behaviors and improper
40:15 - content so we all now realize that some
40:19 - kind
40:20 - of regulation is really needed and we
40:24 - are all trying to find the proper
40:25 - balance between regulation and freedom
40:28 - of expression as suzanne mentioned
40:32 - before
40:33 - uh as far as the elections are concerned
40:38 - i said that the
40:39 - uh tech platforms could be part of the
40:42 - solution and part of the problem they
40:44 - are part of the problem
40:46 - when
40:47 - and one thing i want to
40:49 - emphasize here also julia i was vice
40:52 - president of the superior electoral
40:54 - court in the 2018 elections and i was
40:57 - the president in the 2020 elections
41:00 - in 2018 you would talk to the social
41:03 - media to the platforms
41:05 - and
41:06 - their discourse was well i'm just the
41:09 - avenue i don't produce this information
41:11 - i don't want to be a private sensor and
41:14 - there isn't much i can do
41:16 - and in 2020
41:18 - this behavior had completely changed
41:21 - and i think that the platforms realized
41:24 - that they were having a major loss of
41:27 - image because they started to be
41:29 - associated to destructing democracy or
41:32 - or making it much worse than it was
41:36 - before so one thing i i think i should
41:38 - point out is that the platforms were
41:40 - much more cooperative
41:42 - much more helpful
41:44 - during the 2020 elections and on the
41:47 - positive side here in brazil
41:50 - i enter we entered partnerships with all
41:53 - of them
41:54 - with customized measures
41:56 - to fight misinformation to fight hate
41:59 - speech and especially with whatsapp we
42:03 - had this major partnership to ban
42:07 - accounts that were
42:09 - doing what we call bulk messagings
42:12 - or or you know
42:14 - conveying fake news we had uh agreements
42:18 - with all of them
42:19 - that our rectification of fake news
42:23 - would be exposed and the links would be
42:25 - easily accessible to
42:27 - [Music]
42:28 - all uh people that were
42:31 - had accounts in those uh social media so
42:34 - it it they really changed
42:37 - their behavior for for better and i i
42:39 - think we should acknowledge uh that
42:42 - although as we all know and this is very
42:45 - unfortunate for the human condition
42:48 - uh
42:49 - hate
42:50 - lies
42:51 - sensationalism unfortunately brings much
42:54 - more engagement
42:55 - than a
42:56 - reasonable truthful speech
42:59 - so sometimes you have the wrong
43:01 - incentives to to the platforms that's
43:04 - why we need uh regulation but mostly i
43:07 - think we need self-regulations and clear
43:10 - rules
43:11 - for moderating content
43:13 - by the platforms themselves which is
43:16 - something that i think it should be
43:18 - incentivized
43:20 - and the platforms need to be transparent
43:23 - you need to know the criteria they are
43:25 - using their terms of use
43:28 - i think we need due process so that
43:30 - people can
43:32 - complain or appeal and i think we need
43:34 - fairness
43:36 - you cannot be excluded because you're
43:38 - more liberal or you're more conservative
43:41 - so moderating
43:43 - content is something very important but
43:45 - we don't want
43:47 - to get rid of state censorship and start
43:50 - having private censorship so we are you
43:53 - know trying to strike balances
43:55 - but uh specifically answer answering to
43:58 - your question
44:00 - i can say that platforms were
44:03 - good allies in in brazil in the 2020
44:07 - elections in helping us
44:09 - fighting
44:11 - misinformation especially misinformation
44:14 - regarding the electoral system
44:18 - there isn't much we can do
44:21 - when we're dealing with misinformation
44:24 - uh
44:25 - you know between candidates and things
44:28 - that one are saying about the other that
44:30 - that's tougher so our role here at the
44:34 - court
44:35 - that the court in brazil adjudicates
44:37 - cases and and also organizes the
44:40 - elections
44:41 - so uh
44:42 - our main concern here was to protect
44:46 - the integrity and the image of the
44:48 - electoral system you might know that we
44:51 - have a an electronic ballot box system
44:54 - it's totally electronic there's no paper
44:57 - in our elections
44:58 - and many people
45:00 - that are
45:01 - still not digital pretty analog
45:04 - they criticize strongly the system
45:07 - saying that it's
45:09 - uh
45:10 - brings about frauds and and there's
45:12 - never been any evidence of anything
45:14 - wrong so we spent a lot of energy with
45:17 - the help of the social media
45:20 - to
45:22 - reassure
45:23 - voters and the people of the integrity
45:25 - of the system
45:27 - so
45:28 - fake news misinformation hate speech
45:33 - travels in in social media unfortunately
45:36 - but on the other hand
45:39 - these partnerships that we entered
45:42 - helped us
45:44 - fight them
45:45 - and i think that you know at the end of
45:47 - the day
45:48 - the balance has been positive and we
45:52 - have been able
45:53 - to
45:54 - not avoid uh misinformation
45:58 - but to convey to good faith
46:01 - people in good faith the integrity of
46:04 - the system and uh
46:05 - and i'm telling you we resisted all sort
46:08 - of all sorts of attacks coming from
46:12 - uh where you would least expect
46:14 - and still i think the integrity of the
46:16 - system was preserved and the image
46:19 - of its integrity was preserved and i
46:22 - think social media had to a certain
46:24 - extent a important role in in promoting
46:28 - this end
46:31 - thank you and it's
46:32 - it's good to hear that you feel like
46:34 - there has been a bit of a change
46:36 - uh in
46:37 - the the social media platforms um which
46:40 - i'd like to talk to to suit to suzanne
46:42 - about a little bit more
46:43 - um
46:44 - and you know i know it's something that
46:46 - probably every single person on this
46:48 - panel has been like ringing the bell on
46:49 - for years and years and years and years
46:51 - so it's it's nice to hear that
46:53 - uh they you know they finally do feel
46:55 - like their feet are a little bit uh
46:58 - against the fire um but so susan you
47:01 - know to what extent you know it sounds
47:03 - like from justice for also that things
47:05 - like
47:06 - these new policies related to um
47:08 - elections misinformation
47:10 - um you know that uh
47:13 - in terms of the sort of clear-cut
47:15 - um
47:17 - uh basic voter information uh that
47:20 - they're they're doing a better job of
47:21 - moderating um we hear a lot about
47:24 - takedowns and the you know election
47:26 - other election integrity initiative
47:28 - initiatives and transparency initiatives
47:30 - like are these working
47:32 - um are things getting better um how
47:35 - serious um do you think the platforms
47:38 - really are about this um and and you
47:40 - know sort of generally what role and
47:42 - responsibility do you think um that they
47:45 - should be playing uh in terms of
47:47 - restoring democracy and combating uh
47:50 - information manipulation online
47:52 - yeah sure look i agree i think they are
47:55 - taking it a lot more seriously and they
47:56 - have come under a lot of fire they fear
47:59 - regulation uh and that has
48:03 - been a motivating force at the same time
48:07 - you know we and we see this
48:09 - uh across the board there's this kind of
48:11 - fundamental tension between the way that
48:13 - their business models operate and some
48:15 - of the measures that seem to be
48:18 - most effective in addressing
48:20 - disinformation and sometimes different
48:23 - platforms are dealing with those
48:25 - tensions differently we saw uh you know
48:27 - in 2020
48:29 - when twitter decided they were going to
48:32 - disallow political advertising entirely
48:35 - on the platform rather than getting into
48:37 - fact checking whereas facebook decided
48:40 - that they were not going to fact check
48:41 - uh political ads and that was a very
48:45 - controversial decision that uh they
48:47 - justified mark zuckerberg justified uh
48:50 - on free
48:52 - expression grounds but i think i think
48:54 - uh you know from the perspective of many
48:55 - free speech defenders really uh you know
48:58 - kind of tipped the scales when we deal
49:00 - with this delicate balance between
49:03 - uh wanting to protect free expression
49:05 - and also wanting to combat uh forms of
49:07 - disinformation that can themselves
49:09 - corrode free expression and open
49:11 - discourse uh you know it's not a simple
49:14 - equation and so uh the kinds of line
49:17 - drawing that they're doing uh you know
49:20 - aren't you know isn't always uh it's not
49:23 - always clear you know there are
49:25 - difficult questions and uh you know what
49:28 - goes far enough when it seems like you
49:29 - know with each
49:31 - new election we confront a different
49:33 - problem for example in 2020 in the
49:35 - united states when it came to the run-up
49:38 - to the election we were very focused on
49:40 - that at pet america and on
49:42 - trying to curb the spread of
49:44 - disinformation make people aware of how
49:47 - the election was going to be different
49:49 - than normal we did a whole campaign
49:50 - called what to expect when you're
49:52 - electing which was about mail-in ballots
49:55 - and the fact that the elections wouldn't
49:56 - be called on election night the way uh
49:59 - we are used to
50:01 - in this country and then that was normal
50:03 - and to set people up and set the
50:05 - mainstream media up to
50:08 - report out election night without being
50:10 - able to make those uh calls that keep it
50:12 - so
50:13 - dramatic and uh
50:15 - have everybody riveted and you know all
50:17 - that went rather well and i think things
50:19 - stayed calm for the several days that it
50:21 - took to
50:22 - actually make the call about who had won
50:24 - the election and yet nobody had quite
50:27 - thought about this aftermath or not uh
50:30 - to the degree that obviously uh we
50:32 - needed to in order to combat uh the
50:35 - disinformation that spread didn't stop
50:36 - the steel movement and the uh march
50:39 - toward
50:40 - january 6th and so you know it was an
50:42 - illustration of just the the it's a kind
50:44 - of octopus-like problem with many
50:47 - tentacles and it's protea you know
50:49 - changes for every election and those who
50:51 - are
50:52 - using disinformation as a tool are
50:54 - learning from every cycle they're
50:56 - learning from you know what the
50:57 - brazilians uh and facebook got right in
51:00 - 20 you know in the last election and
51:02 - then they will evolve their tactics for
51:05 - the next election so uh it's not you
51:08 - know this is not a problem that's going
51:10 - to be solved once for once and for all i
51:13 - think it's going to be a continual kind
51:15 - of arms race of tactics uh new and
51:18 - innovative tactics uh of dissembling and
51:21 - platforms trying to
51:23 - respond to them you know from from the
51:25 - perspective of the oversight board in
51:27 - the trump case uh the oversight board
51:29 - asked facebook to undertake
51:32 - a research initiative of its own to look
51:34 - at the platform's role in contributing
51:36 - to
51:37 - january 6th and you know facebook
51:40 - claimed to be implementing that in part
51:42 - they're really
51:43 - uh essentially you know seemingly not
51:46 - implementing it but they are working
51:47 - with a consortium of researchers of
51:49 - course we also know that researchers
51:51 - though have had a lot of difficulty
51:53 - getting
51:54 - the information and transparency that
51:56 - they need from facebook and other
51:58 - platforms in order to carry out their
51:59 - work and that's a huge
52:01 - barrier i agree with idiot that i think
52:04 - the uh
52:05 - the the access for researchers and the
52:07 - ability to
52:09 - analyze and document the impact of the
52:11 - platforms on elections is an absolutely
52:14 - critical piece i think the algorithmic
52:16 - transparency is also something that the
52:19 - oversight board
52:20 - uh asked for uh facebook to provide and
52:23 - really was uh kind of pushed back in
52:25 - terms of how donald trump's
52:27 - posts were moved through the platform
52:30 - and were accelerated uh by the platform
52:32 - and that you know sort of remains a
52:35 - gray area i think there are also
52:37 - resource issues in terms of uh elections
52:40 - around the world and disparities and uh
52:42 - as far as how well the pla how well
52:44 - prepared the platforms are we often see
52:47 - at the oversight board uh issues of
52:49 - under capacity under preparation
52:52 - understaffing lack of language expertise
52:55 - uh and translation capabilities in real
52:58 - time to deal with content uh that may be
53:01 - very
53:02 - sensitive and so i think the you know
53:04 - there's there's always you always hear
53:05 - about you know how how head head
53:08 - spinningly difficult it is to do all of
53:10 - this
53:11 - at scale uh and that's true but you know
53:15 - that is the challenge i mean the
53:17 - companies are at a scale where they have
53:19 - to match these capabilities to that
53:22 - scale uh the facebook has also announced
53:24 - it's creating
53:26 - a new version of the an oversight board
53:28 - that will specifically focus on
53:29 - elections and bring in
53:32 - expertise to set rules uh in terms of
53:35 - how to you know what what what should be
53:38 - allowed and disa lot of the platform and
53:40 - how content should be moderated
53:41 - specifically
53:42 - in the election context you know i think
53:44 - that's a positive step i think the
53:46 - outside expertise if they really are
53:48 - willing to empower that group to give
53:51 - that group the access that they will
53:53 - need to the kinds of information that
53:55 - make it possible to render sound
53:58 - recommendations and guidelines i think
54:00 - that could represent a positive step
54:06 - great thank you so much we are running a
54:08 - little short on time but i did want to
54:10 - throw out one more question and
54:12 - um
54:13 - this will go out to all the panelists
54:15 - and and just feel free if you have some
54:17 - strong feelings about it um
54:19 - to answer because i did want to talk a
54:22 - bit about um something that we know
54:25 - about
54:26 - disinformation campaigns
54:28 - have often specifically targeted women
54:31 - and marginalized communities
54:33 - and can create hostile online
54:35 - environments that actively exclude them
54:37 - from the political discourse which is at
54:39 - the end of the day also an electoral
54:40 - integrity issue
54:42 - um how can we promote information
54:44 - environments around elections um that
54:48 - are inclusive for all voters um and and
54:51 - make sure that that we're we're
54:52 - promoting healthy environments for all
54:54 - voters i don't know if anybody has any
54:56 - um
54:58 - wants to respond to that in particular
55:01 - yeah i mean i could say a few words
55:03 - because we do a great deal of work at
55:04 - pan america on the issue of
55:07 - online harassment and it uh it focuses
55:10 - primarily on writers and journalists but
55:13 - much of the guidance is really uh
55:16 - relevant to anybody who experiences
55:18 - online harassment and we increasingly
55:21 - confront the intersection of online
55:23 - harassment and disinformation that
55:26 - disinformation purveyors are
55:29 - harassing uh whether it's journalists or
55:32 - activists who they uh see as inimical to
55:36 - their purposes that disinformation is
55:38 - used as a
55:40 - tool of harassment and so there's a kind
55:42 - of uh merging here we've uh put out a
55:45 - report that i'll put in the chat called
55:47 - no excuse for abuse
55:49 - that urges social media companies to
55:52 - take a series of very specific steps
55:55 - at the design level of the platforms to
55:58 - better uh equip and empower users to
56:00 - protect themselves against harassment i
56:02 - think that that's one of the
56:04 - implementation of those steps some of
56:05 - which has started uh
56:07 - is is is a a crucial way forward here
56:14 - thank you uh
56:17 - yeah justice barroso or daya do you have
56:19 - anything to add
56:21 - well yes uh
56:22 - yeah there's there's something going on
56:25 - in the world i i would say that
56:27 - liberated
56:28 - many demos
56:30 - the fascists the
56:34 - misogynist homophobics
56:37 - the racist supremacists anti ein var
56:42 - anti-environmental
56:45 - they are all out there
56:47 - uh in in a fashion that was unseen
56:50 - before
56:52 - so uh
56:54 - the the world really needs
56:56 - uh julia kind of a shock
56:59 - of civility humanism and and
57:02 - enlightenment uh
57:04 - this combination that we see around the
57:07 - world of populism
57:10 - extremism and
57:12 - authoritarianism has released as i
57:14 - mentioned all these uh mounted monsters
57:18 - i think i think there's rules for
57:20 - everyone i think the platforms
57:22 - have
57:23 - a main role so we all prefer
57:26 - self-regulation
57:28 - rather than
57:29 - governmental regulations so i think they
57:32 - should be tough on fighting this they
57:34 - should have
57:36 - very clear terms of use and good
57:38 - algorithms fighting hate speech and
57:42 - fighting discrimination and all
57:44 - derogatory uh speech against women and
57:47 - minorities and and
57:50 - african descendants and and gays so
57:53 - first role i think should be for the
57:54 - platforms i think the government the
57:57 - state has a role also in good
57:59 - legislation
58:01 - and with court intervention in in brazil
58:04 - the platform will never be liable will
58:07 - only be liable if after a court order
58:11 - they don't take down the content that is
58:15 - targeted uh but i think in many cases
58:18 - the platform the platform should be more
58:21 - proactive but i think the government
58:23 - government has a role in drawing a
58:26 - framework and courts have a role in
58:29 - uh removing improper content and i think
58:33 - finally and i think this is very
58:35 - important we should address civil
58:37 - society we should
58:40 - give media education to people more
58:42 - generally here the
58:45 - electoral court that i preside
58:47 - we had a major television campaign with
58:50 - a very famous youtuber explaining what
58:53 - fake news were how to avoid them and not
58:57 - to
58:58 - pass it along when when you receive fake
59:01 - news without checking and i think we
59:03 - were very successful in bringing in
59:06 - bringing awareness
59:08 - to this problem because there is major
59:10 - digital illiteracy in in the population
59:13 - all over the world still
59:15 - so i think we need self-proactive
59:19 - behavior from the platforms
59:21 - some
59:23 - state regulations and sometimes court
59:25 - orders and we need to educate civil
59:28 - society i have the hope
59:31 - uh julius suzanne and he died
59:34 - that
59:35 - will happen to to misinformation
59:38 - kind of what happened to pornography in
59:41 - the 70s
59:43 - people were very concerned that
59:45 - pornography would take over
59:48 - and it would would become mainstream
59:51 - and over time it was kind of pushed to
59:55 - the margin of history and it's kind of a
59:57 - small ghetto where people go only if
59:59 - they want to consume that but it didn't
60:02 - reach the mainstream
60:04 - so
60:05 - we are facing a moment in
60:07 - the history of the world
60:09 - where extremism
60:12 - far right extremism quite often
60:15 - uh
60:15 - had access to the mainstream
60:18 - and we need to push it back to the
60:20 - margin of history
60:22 - to have a an environment of respect and
60:26 - tolerance
60:27 - for all world views
60:29 - without violence without
60:32 - aggressiveness without this
60:35 - disqualification of the other
60:37 - that characterizes
60:39 - hate speech and and misinformation
60:42 - i in one of the campaigns that i led
60:44 - here in brazil
60:46 - and trying to
60:48 - distribute people of uh embarking in
60:51 - this
60:52 - behavior was
60:54 - a cause
60:56 - that needs hate
60:59 - lies
61:00 - and aggressiveness
61:02 - cannot be a good cause
61:04 - so beware
61:06 - when people try to conquer your heart
61:09 - using these means
61:11 - because they're not taking you
61:13 - in the right path
61:15 - and i think once you can convey this
61:17 - message and touch the heart of goodwill
61:19 - people
61:20 - because we're talking
61:22 - uh julia and this is one thing i want to
61:25 - say i
61:26 - uh i am the head of the electoral court
61:28 - i'm in on twitter
61:30 - so that i can you know talk to everyone
61:32 - at the same time
61:34 - and
61:35 - in in one post a friend of mine wrote
61:40 - there is
61:41 - uh
61:42 - 300
61:44 - hate comments
61:46 - to your post
61:48 - and then
61:49 - i said yes but there are 60 000 people
61:54 - that watch them
61:56 - meaning that people that convey hate
62:00 - they are a small percentage they make a
62:02 - lot of noise
62:04 - but they're not the majority
62:06 - so what we need to do
62:08 - on media education is talking to the
62:11 - majority of people
62:12 - that are in good faith that have good
62:14 - will and make sure that they know
62:17 - what is happening so that they won't be
62:20 - accomplices to things that if they are
62:23 - aware they don't want to be
62:25 - and you know create a world of more
62:29 - tolerance and
62:31 - concern and respect for everyone
62:34 - so i think
62:36 - as much as
62:37 - we might need
62:39 - legislation and self-regulation
62:42 - i especially think we need to educate
62:45 - people
62:46 - because i think the majority of the
62:48 - people are in good faith they just need
62:51 - to know better
62:55 - okay thank you very much how just had in
62:58 - one minute to what's the just
63:01 - this asset
63:02 - and which is to continue that we need to
63:05 - teach people more the abc of fact
63:07 - checking the ability to identify fake
63:10 - news and not forward and this might
63:13 - actually entail cancer messaging the
63:16 - same way we counter violent extremism i
63:19 - think we have to develop a toolkit for
63:21 - countering false information and also
63:24 - having ambassadors who come forward with
63:27 - it
63:28 - and i think we also need to support fact
63:30 - checking to change a mindset
63:32 - particularly when it comes to the role
63:35 - gender uh and
63:37 - uh in and disinformation itself we need
63:40 - a lot to do more
63:43 - using even fact checking to change the
63:45 - mindset of the people as well as voting
63:48 - more resources to specifically look at
63:51 - how this actually impacts
63:54 - the electoral future of women and female
63:58 - activists
63:59 - and lastly we need to support quality
64:02 - journalism
64:03 - we need to start thinking of addressing
64:06 - this information in a way that we
64:08 - support quality journalism with fat
64:11 - check desk in each of the media houses
64:14 - but beyond that an ombudsman which also
64:17 - promotes accountability for any form of
64:20 - false information that goes out on these
64:24 - sites thank you very much
64:29 - thank you very much um we are gonna i
64:31 - unfortunately probably have to wrap it
64:33 - up we're over time already even though i
64:35 - want to just keep talking to you all and
64:38 - um i you know i think
64:41 - it's it's heartening this is always a
64:43 - challenging issue when we're confronting
64:45 - um the impact of digital transformation
64:48 - on elections it can be very daunting um
64:50 - you know i think one of the first steps
64:52 - was sort of recognizing this as an
64:53 - electoral integrity issue that it's not
64:56 - enough to talk about elections in terms
64:58 - of
64:58 - you know did the voter registration
65:00 - process go smoothly and was everybody
65:04 - uh able to
65:05 - to cast their ballot on election day but
65:07 - to really think about the information
65:09 - space do voters have the information
65:10 - they need to be able to participate and
65:13 - to form opinions without manipulation
65:16 - um but you know i think that
65:18 - you know it does seem like our efforts
65:20 - are
65:21 - are making a difference and even though
65:23 - this issue can seem very daunting um
65:25 - there are we are making some progress um
65:28 - and i really appreciate the perspectives
65:30 - that you all um were able to to add to
65:33 - this discussion today and i really just
65:35 - as bro so i love their your uh you know
65:38 - we need a shock of civility and humanism
65:42 - and
65:43 - uh and enlightenment to battle some of
65:46 - these demons i will make you the the
65:48 - elections poet laureate
