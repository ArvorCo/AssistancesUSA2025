TST MEASURES AN IN VIVO CELLULAR REACTION MEDIATED BY TH1 CELLS AT THE SITE OF TUBERCULIN INJECTION. ALTHOUGH TST DETECTS PREVIOUS EXPOSURE TO MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS (MTB), IT PRESENTS LOW SPECIFICITY AND IS NOT CAPABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE LATENT INFECTION FROM ACTIVE TB DISEASE. FEW YEARS AGO, THE IDENTIFICATION OF HIGHLY SPECIFIC RD1 REGION IN MTB GENOME DROVE THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW IN VITRO TB SPECIFIC TESTS. THE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE QUANTIFERON(R) TB GOLD IN TUBE6 IS AN EXAMPLE OF SUCH IN VITRO TESTS (ALSO KNOWN AS IGRA). IGRA DETECTS IFN- RELEASED FROM LYMPHOCYTES AFTER IN VITRO INCUBATION WITH MTB ANTIGENS. AS OPPOSED TO TST, IGRA OFFER ENHANCED SPECIFICITY AND ARE NOT INFLUENCED BY CROSS-REACTIVITY TO BCG AND OTHER NON-TUBERCULOUS MYCOBACTERIA (NTM). HOWEVER, IT IS STILL CONTROVERSIAL WHETHER IGRA CAN REPLACE TST AS THE DIAGNOSTIC TEST OF CHOICE. ALTHOUGH IGRA IS, BY DEFINITION, MORE SPECIFIC THAN TST, SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE REPORTED AN ELEVATED FREQUENCY OF IGRA REVERSIONS AND CONVERSIONS7-15 AS WELL AS DISCORDANCE BETWEEN IGRA AND TST 4, 16, 17. WE, RECENTLY, REPORTED A HIGH DISCORDANCE RATE (21%) BETWEEN THE TWO TESTS, WITH THE MAJORITY OF DISCORDANCE COMING FROM HHC WITH TST POSITIVE AND IGRA NEGATIVE RESULTS. THESE FINDINGS18 ALLOW US TO DIFFERENTIATE MTB-EXPOSED INDIVIDUALS FROM UNINFECTED (TST NEGATIVE, IGRA NEGATIVE), NEW INFECTION (TST POSITIVE/CONVERTED, IGRA NEGATIVE) AND REMOTE INFECTION (TST AND IGRA POSITIVE). USING SAMPLES FROM THESE THREE GROUPS, WE PROPOSE TO DISSECT THE MECHANISM FOR TST/IGRA DISCORDANCY AND TO IDENTIFY BIOMARKERS PREDICTIVE OF NEW INFECTION. WE POSIT THAT IN THE IN-VIVO TST, RECRUITMENT OF ANTIGEN-SPECIFIC T CELLS AND T REGULATORY CELLS (TREGS) TO THE INJECTION SITE I TEMPORALLY SEGREGATED. WHEREAS IN THE IN-VITRO IGRA CONCURRENT PRESENCE OF ANTIGEN-SPECIFIC T CELLS AND TREGS ATTENUATES ANTIGEN-SPECIFIC T CELL EXPANSION AND ATTENDANT IFN- SECRETION, LEADING TO DIFFERENCES IN SENSITIVITY AND A DELAYED IGRA CONVERSION. OUR FINDING OF TST AND IGRA DISCORDANT SUBJECTS IS A SIGNIFICANT ASPECT OF OUR PROPOSAL SINCE WITHOUT THIS GROUP WE WOULD HAVE MISSED IDENTIFICATION OF BIOMARKERS OF NEW INFECTION. COMPARATIVE GENE EXPRESSION ANALYSIS OF STIMULATED WHOLE BLOOD CELLS FROM THE THREE GROUPS OF SUBJECTS WILL ALLOW THE IDENTIFICATION OF GENES THAT ARE ONLY EXPRESSED IN NEWLY AND RECENTLY-INFECTED CONTACTS, WITH THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE BIOMARKER(S) THAT CAN DISTINGUISH THESE TWO GROUPS OF LTBI WITH THE HIGHEST RISK OF PROGRESSION TO DISEASE FROM THE LARGER GROUP OF LTBI WITH REMOTE INFECTION. THE KNOWLEDGE GAINED WITH THIS PROPOSAL WILL HELP WITH THE ELUCIDATION OF IMMUNOLOGICAL BASIS OF TST/IGRA DISCORDANCE, WHICH IN TURN MAY ALLOW THE IMPROVEMENT OF IN-VITRO TB DIAGNOSTICS. ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION IS THAT THE BIOMARKERS OF NEW INFECTION WILL PERMIT DISTINCTION BETWEEN NEW AND REMOTE INFECTION, ALLOWING IDENTIFICATION OF NEWLY INFECTED INDIVIDUALS FOR PROPHYLAXIS.|IGRA INVESTIGATION IN RECENTLY EXPOSED CONTACTS - DESCRIPTION (PROVIDED BY APPLICANT): TUBERCULIN SKIN TEST (TST) WAS DEVELOPED BY ROBERT KOCH IN 1890 AND STILL IS THE METHOD OF CHOICE IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF TUBERCULOSIS (TB).

COMPARATIVE GENE EXPRESSION ANALYSIS OF STIMULATED WHOLE BLOOD CELLS FROM THE THREE GROUPS OF SUBJECTS WILL ALLOW THE IDENTIFICATION OF GENES THAT ARE ONLY EXPRESSED IN NEWLY AND RECENTLY-INFECTED CONTACTS, WITH THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE BIOMARKER(S) THAT CAN DISTINGUISH THESE TWO GROUPS OF LTBI WITH THE HIGHEST RISK OF PROGRESSION TO DISEASE FROM THE LARGER GROUP OF LTBI WITH REMOTE INFECTION. THE KNOWLEDGE GAINED WITH THIS PROPOSAL WILL HELP WITH THE ELUCIDATION OF IMMUNOLOGICAL BASIS OF TST/IGRA DISCORDANCE, WHICH IN TURN MAY ALLOW THE IMPROVEMENT OF IN-VITRO TB DIAGNOSTICS. ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION IS THAT THE BIOMARKERS OF NEW INFECTION WILL PERMIT DISTINCTION BETWEEN NEW AND REMOTE INFECTION, ALLOWING IDENTIFICATION OF NEWLY INFECTED INDIVIDUALS FOR PROPHYLAXIS.|2022-10-01|Department of Health and Human Services|National Institutes of Health|UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DO ESPIRITO SANTO||BRAZIL|BRAZIL|||||||

TWO VACCINES ARE IN EARLY STAGE CLINICAL TRIALS AND BOTH TARGET DOMAINS WITHIN THE PROTEIN VAR2CSA, WHICH IS THE MAJOR SURFACE ANTIGEN EXPRESSED BY PLASMODIUM FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL ISOLATES. THIS PROTEIN BINDS TO RECEPTORS IN THE PLACENTA AND MEDIATES SEQUESTRATION OF INFECTED RED BLOOD CELLS (IRBCS), UNDERPINNING THE PATHOGENESIS OF PLACENTAL MALARIA. HOWEVER, VAR2CSA IS UNDER STRONG IMMUNE SELECTION AND IS HIGHLY POLYMORPHIC; THIS COMPROMISES VACCINE EFFICACY BY LIMITING THE BREADTH OF PROTECTION AGAINST DIVERSE ALLELES. POLYMORPHIC ANTIGENS PRESENT A UBIQUITOUS CHALLENGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MALARIA SUBUNIT VACCINES. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO A VACCINE AGAINST PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED MALARIA THAT TARGETS HIGHLY CONSERVED, SUBDOMINANT (EVEN CRYPTIC) EPITOPES. WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT THIS APPROACH IS THAT IT EXPLOITS A MECHANISM OF CROSS- SPECIES IMMUNITY, WHERE EPITOPES FROM ONE PLASMODIUM SPECIES ELICIT ROBUST, BROADLY NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES AGAINST STRUCTURALLY RELATED ANTIGENS FROM ANOTHER SPECIES. THIS MECHANISM WAS DISCOVERED RECENTLY IN COLOMBIAN AND BRAZILIAN POPULATIONS WHERE VAR2CSA ANTIBODIES CAN BE ACQUIRED OUTSIDE OF PREGNANCY FOLLOWING INFECTION WITH P.

THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH SYNTHESIS OF THREE COMPLEMENTARY SPECIFIC AIMS. EPITOPES REQUIRED TO ELICIT FUNCTIONAL, CROSS-REACTIVE ANTIBODIES WILL BE IDENTIFIED IN AIM 1 THROUGH CONFORMATIONALLY CONSTRICTED PEPTIDE MICROARRAYS SCREENED WITH MOUSE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES (MABS) AND HUMAN MABS TO SD1 ISOLATED FROM COLOMBIAN STUDY POPULATIONS.

TWO VACCINES ARE IN EARLY STAGE CLINICAL TRIALS AND BOTH TARGET DOMAINS WITHIN THE PROTEIN VAR2CSA, WHICH IS THE MAJOR SURFACE ANTIGEN EXPRESSED BY PLASMODIUM FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL ISOLATES. THIS PROTEIN BINDS TO RECEPTORS IN THE PLACENTA AND MEDIATES SEQUESTRATION OF INFECTED RED BLOOD CELLS (IRBCS), UNDERPINNING THE PATHOGENESIS OF PLACENTAL MALARIA. HOWEVER, VAR2CSA IS UNDER STRONG IMMUNE SELECTION AND IS HIGHLY POLYMORPHIC; THIS COMPROMISES VACCINE EFFICACY BY LIMITING THE BREADTH OF PROTECTION AGAINST DIVERSE ALLELES. POLYMORPHIC ANTIGENS PRESENT A UBIQUITOUS CHALLENGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MALARIA SUBUNIT VACCINES. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO A VACCINE AGAINST PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED MALARIA THAT TARGETS HIGHLY CONSERVED, SUBDOMINANT (EVEN CRYPTIC) EPITOPES. WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT THIS APPROACH IS THAT IT EXPLOITS A MECHANISM OF CROSS- SPECIES IMMUNITY, WHERE EPITOPES FROM ONE PLASMODIUM SPECIES ELICIT ROBUST, BROADLY NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES AGAINST STRUCTURALLY RELATED ANTIGENS FROM ANOTHER SPECIES. THIS MECHANISM WAS DISCOVERED RECENTLY IN COLOMBIAN AND BRAZILIAN POPULATIONS WHERE VAR2CSA ANTIBODIES CAN BE ACQUIRED OUTSIDE OF PREGNANCY FOLLOWING INFECTION WITH P. VIVAX, AND THESE ANTIBODIES BLOCKED SEQUESTRATION OF IRBCS USING IN VITRO CORRELATES OF PLACENTAL MALARIA. THE CROSS-REACTIVE EPITOPE IN P. VIVAX WAS MAPPED TO SUBDOMAIN (SD1) IN PVDBP AND HUMAN SD1-PURIFIED ANTIBODIES BLOCKED PARASITE ADHESION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A VACCINE TO PROTECT PREGNANT WOMEN FROM FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL MALARIA THAT IS BASED ON THE CROSS- REACTIVE EPITOPE IN VIVAX SD1. THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH SYNTHESIS OF THREE COMPLEMENTARY SPECIFIC AIMS. EPITOPES REQUIRED TO ELICIT FUNCTIONAL, CROSS-REACTIVE ANTIBODIES WILL BE IDENTIFIED IN AIM 1 THROUGH CONFORMATIONALLY CONSTRICTED PEPTIDE MICROARRAYS SCREENED WITH MOUSE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES (MABS) AND HUMAN MABS TO SD1 ISOLATED FROM COLOMBIAN STUDY POPULATIONS. EPITOPES WILL BE SYNTHESIZED AS PEPTIDE- CONJUGATES OR WITHIN ENGINEERED RECOMBINANT DOMAINS, AND IMMUNOGENICITY WILL BE OPTIMIZED IN AIM 2 TO PRODUCE ANTIBODIES WITH FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY AGAINST PARASITES THAT EXPRESS DIVERSE ALLELES OF VAR2CSA. IN THE THIRD AIM, THE CRYPTIC EPITOPES IN VAR2CSA RECOGNIZED BY THESE ANTIBODIES WILL BE MAPPED TO IDENTIFY THE TARGETS OF ANTIBODIES ELICITED BY AN SD1-DERIVED VACCINE. THE INTEGRATION OF THESE FINDINGS WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT INSIGHT INTO THE MECHANISM OF CROSS-SPECIES EPITOPE RECOGNITION, WHICH WILL SERVE AS THE BASIS FOR A VIVAX VACCINE AGAINST FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL MALARIA AND COULD BE APPLIED MORE BROADLY TO VACCINES AGAINST OTHER MALARIA ANTIGENS.|EXPLOITING CROSS-REACTIVE, CONSERVED EPITOPES IN PLASMODIUM VIVAX TO DEVELOP A VACCINE AGAINST FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL MALARIA. - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A VACCINE IS URGENTLY NEEDED TO PROTECT PREGNANT WOMEN FROM MALARIA INFECTION AND THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF THIS DISEASE ON MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH. TWO VACCINES ARE IN EARLY STAGE CLINICAL TRIALS AND BOTH TARGET DOMAINS WITHIN THE PROTEIN VAR2CSA, WHICH IS THE MAJOR SURFACE ANTIGEN EXPRESSED BY PLASMODIUM FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL ISOLATES. THIS PROTEIN BINDS TO RECEPTORS IN THE PLACENTA AND MEDIATES SEQUESTRATION OF INFECTED RED BLOOD CELLS (IRBCS), UNDERPINNING THE PATHOGENESIS OF PLACENTAL MALARIA. HOWEVER, VAR2CSA IS UNDER STRONG IMMUNE SELECTION AND IS HIGHLY POLYMORPHIC; THIS COMPROMISES VACCINE EFFICACY BY LIMITING THE BREADTH OF PROTECTION AGAINST DIVERSE ALLELES. POLYMORPHIC ANTIGENS PRESENT A UBIQUITOUS CHALLENGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MALARIA SUBUNIT VACCINES. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO A VACCINE AGAINST PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED MALARIA THAT TARGETS HIGHLY CONSERVED, SUBDOMINANT (EVEN CRYPTIC) EPITOPES. WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT THIS APPROACH IS THAT IT EXPLOITS A MECHANISM OF CROSS- SPECIES IMMUNITY, WHERE EPITOPES FROM ONE PLASMODIUM SPECIES ELICIT ROBUST, BROADLY NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES AGAINST STRUCTURALLY RELATED ANTIGENS FROM ANOTHER SPECIES. THIS MECHANISM WAS DISCOVERED RECENTLY IN COLOMBIAN AND BRAZILIAN POPULATIONS WHERE VAR2CSA ANTIBODIES CAN BE ACQUIRED OUTSIDE OF PREGNANCY FOLLOWING INFECTION WITH P. VIVAX, AND THESE ANTIBODIES BLOCKED SEQUESTRATION OF IRBCS USING IN VITRO CORRELATES OF PLACENTAL MALARIA. THE CROSS-REACTIVE EPITOPE IN P. VIVAX WAS MAPPED TO SUBDOMAIN (SD1) IN PVDBP AND HUMAN SD1-PURIFIED ANTIBODIES BLOCKED PARASITE ADHESION.

THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE INDIVIDUALS EXPOSED TO M. LEPRAE BECOMES INFECTED, BUT ONLY A SMALL PROPORTION OF THE INFECTED INDIVIDUALS EVOLVES TO ACTIVE DISEASE. PREVIOUS WORK IN LEPROSY AND TUBERCULOSIS DEMONSTRATED A MAJOR ROLE OF INTERFERON-Γ, AN EFFECTOR CYTOKINE PRODUCED BY PATHOGEN-SPECIFIC MEMORY CD4 T CELLS, IN THE CONTROL OF THE INFECTION BY THESE INTRACELLULAR PATHOGENS. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA SHOW A PROGRESSIVE REDUCTION IN M. LEPRAE-SPECIFIC IFNΓ LEVELS IN INDIVIDUALS THAT CORRELATES TO INDICATORS OF LEVEL OF EXPOSURE TO M. LEPRAE AND TO BACILLARY LOAD IN INDIVIDUALS WITH LEPROSY. WHEN WE EVALUATED THE INTERACTION OF M. LEPRAE WITH SCHWANN CELLS AND MONONUCLEAR PHAGOCYTES, WE OBSERVED AN INDUCTION OF THE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINE IL-10 AND THE LIPID MEDIATOR PGE-2. METABOLOMICS ANALYSES OF LESIONS AND SERA FROM LEPROSY PATIENTS ALSO DEMONSTRATED CLEAR DIFFERENCES IN THE PRESENCE OF POLYUNSATURATED FATTY ACID (PUFA) DERIVED LIPID MEDIATORS THAT CORRELATED TO THE CLINICAL FORMS OF LEPROSY AND BACILLARY LOADS. OTHER INVESTIGATORS DETECTED FREQUENCIES OF FOXP-3 POSITIVE T CELLS IN THE BLOOD AND LESIONS OF LEPROSY PATIENTS THAT CORRELATE TO THE EXPECTED INHIBITION OF CELLULAR IMMUNITY AND EFFECTOR FUNCTION AGAINST M. LEPRAE IN THE MULTIBACILLARY FORMS OF LEPROSY. TAKING IN TO ACCOUNT THESE FINDINGS, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT M. LEPRAE INTERACTIONS WITH SCHWANN CELLS AND MONONUCLEAR PHAGOCYTES GENERATE A MICROENVIRONMENT VIA THE ACTIVITIES OF LIPID MEDIATOR THAT FACILITATES THE INHIBITION OF PATHOGEN-SPECIFIC IFN-Γ RESPONSE BY TREG.

TWO VACCINES ARE IN EARLY STAGE CLINICAL TRIALS AND BOTH TARGET DOMAINS WITHIN THE PROTEIN VAR2CSA, WHICH IS THE MAJOR SURFACE ANTIGEN EXPRESSED BY PLASMODIUM FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL ISOLATES. THIS PROTEIN BINDS TO RECEPTORS IN THE PLACENTA AND MEDIATES SEQUESTRATION OF INFECTED RED BLOOD CELLS (IRBCS), UNDERPINNING THE PATHOGENESIS OF PLACENTAL MALARIA. HOWEVER, VAR2CSA IS UNDER STRONG IMMUNE SELECTION AND IS HIGHLY POLYMORPHIC; THIS COMPROMISES VACCINE EFFICACY BY LIMITING THE BREADTH OF PROTECTION AGAINST DIVERSE ALLELES. POLYMORPHIC ANTIGENS PRESENT A UBIQUITOUS CHALLENGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MALARIA SUBUNIT VACCINES. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO A VACCINE AGAINST PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED MALARIA THAT TARGETS HIGHLY CONSERVED, SUBDOMINANT (EVEN CRYPTIC) EPITOPES. WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT THIS APPROACH IS THAT IT EXPLOITS A MECHANISM OF CROSS- SPECIES IMMUNITY, WHERE EPITOPES FROM ONE PLASMODIUM SPECIES ELICIT ROBUST, BROADLY NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES AGAINST STRUCTURALLY RELATED ANTIGENS FROM ANOTHER SPECIES. THIS MECHANISM WAS DISCOVERED RECENTLY IN COLOMBIAN AND BRAZILIAN POPULATIONS WHERE VAR2CSA ANTIBODIES CAN BE ACQUIRED OUTSIDE OF PREGNANCY FOLLOWING INFECTION WITH P. VIVAX, AND THESE ANTIBODIES BLOCKED SEQUESTRATION OF IRBCS USING IN VITRO CORRELATES OF PLACENTAL MALARIA. THE CROSS-REACTIVE EPITOPE IN P. VIVAX WAS MAPPED TO SUBDOMAIN (SD1) IN PVDBP AND HUMAN SD1-PURIFIED ANTIBODIES BLOCKED PARASITE ADHESION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A VACCINE TO PROTECT PREGNANT WOMEN FROM FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL MALARIA THAT IS BASED ON THE CROSS- REACTIVE EPITOPE IN VIVAX SD1. THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH SYNTHESIS OF THREE COMPLEMENTARY SPECIFIC AIMS. EPITOPES REQUIRED TO ELICIT FUNCTIONAL, CROSS-REACTIVE ANTIBODIES WILL BE IDENTIFIED IN AIM 1 THROUGH CONFORMATIONALLY CONSTRICTED PEPTIDE MICROARRAYS SCREENED WITH MOUSE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES (MABS) AND HUMAN MABS TO SD1 ISOLATED FROM COLOMBIAN STUDY POPULATIONS. EPITOPES WILL BE SYNTHESIZED AS PEPTIDE- CONJUGATES OR WITHIN ENGINEERED RECOMBINANT DOMAINS, AND IMMUNOGENICITY WILL BE OPTIMIZED IN AIM 2 TO PRODUCE ANTIBODIES WITH FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY AGAINST PARASITES THAT EXPRESS DIVERSE ALLELES OF VAR2CSA. IN THE THIRD AIM, THE CRYPTIC EPITOPES IN VAR2CSA RECOGNIZED BY THESE ANTIBODIES WILL BE MAPPED TO IDENTIFY THE TARGETS OF ANTIBODIES ELICITED BY AN SD1-DERIVED VACCINE. THE INTEGRATION OF THESE FINDINGS WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT INSIGHT INTO THE MECHANISM OF CROSS-SPECIES EPITOPE RECOGNITION, WHICH WILL SERVE AS THE BASIS FOR A VIVAX VACCINE AGAINST FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL MALARIA AND COULD BE APPLIED MORE BROADLY TO VACCINES AGAINST OTHER MALARIA ANTIGENS.|EXPLOITING CROSS-REACTIVE, CONSERVED EPITOPES IN PLASMODIUM VIVAX TO DEVELOP A VACCINE AGAINST FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL MALARIA. - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A VACCINE IS URGENTLY NEEDED TO PROTECT PREGNANT WOMEN FROM MALARIA INFECTION AND THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF THIS DISEASE ON MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH.

TST MEASURES AN IN VIVO CELLULAR REACTION MEDIATED BY TH1 CELLS AT THE SITE OF TUBERCULIN INJECTION. ALTHOUGH TST DETECTS PREVIOUS EXPOSURE TO MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS (MTB), IT PRESENTS LOW SPECIFICITY AND IS NOT CAPABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE LATENT INFECTION FROM ACTIVE TB DISEASE. FEW YEARS AGO, THE IDENTIFICATION OF HIGHLY SPECIFIC RD1 REGION IN MTB GENOME DROVE THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW IN VITRO TB SPECIFIC TESTS. THE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE QUANTIFERON(R) TB GOLD IN TUBE6 IS AN EXAMPLE OF SUCH IN VITRO TESTS (ALSO KNOWN AS IGRA).

BRUCELLA ABORTUS STRAIN 19 VACCINE, DEVELOPED IN THE 1930S, IS THE PRINCIPAL VACCINE USED TO PREVENT TRANSMISSION OF BRUCELLOSIS FROM CATTLE TO HUMANS WORLDWIDE AND IN BRAZIL. THE MECHANISMS THAT MEDIATE PROTECTION BY STRAIN 19 ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD. HOST MECHANISMS OF INNATE IMMUNITY INDUCED BY THE VACCINE THAT CONTROL INFECTION REMAIN OBSCURE. INDEED, THE VACCINE CONTAINS SEVERAL PROPERTIES THAT ARE INHIBITORY TO HOST IMMUNITY. OUR RESEARCH GROUP WAS THE FIRST TO IMPLICATE THE ROLE OF INFLAMMASOME RECEPTORS IN THE CONTROL OF BRUCELLA ABORTUS INFECTION. FURTHER, OUR TEAM HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT IFN-ASSR KO MICE ARE MORE RESISTANT TO INFECTION SUGGESTING THAT TYPE I IFN SIGNALING FAVORS BRUCELLA MULTIPLICATION IN THE HOST. THEREFORE, OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO RESOLVE THE CONUNDRUM OF HOW BRUCELLA ACTIVATES INNATE IMMUNE COMPONENTS THAT RESULTS IN HOST RESISTANCE VERSUS BACTERIAL SUBVERSION OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE. BRUCELLA SPP ARE ONE OF THE FEW BACTERIAL PATHOGENS THAT USE THE ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM (ER) AS ITS REPLICATIVE NICHE. THE UNFOLDED PROTEIN RESPONSE (UPR) IS A CONSERVED SIGNALING PATHWAY IN EUKARYOTES THAT MEDIATES CELLULAR ADAPTATION TO PROTEIN-FOLDING STRESS IN THE ER. THE UPR ALSO MODULATES INNATE IMMUNITY. RECENTLY, OUR COLLABORATORS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT BRUCELLA INDUCES THE UPR THAT ENABLES ITS INTRACELLULAR REPLICATION. BASED ON THESE COMPELLING PRELIMINARY DATA, WE PROPOSE TO TEST THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS THAT BRUCELLA ABORTUS STRAIN 19 ACTIVATES PROTECTIVE INNATE IMMUNE MEDIATORS AND TRIGGERS THE UPR TO SECURE INTRACELLULAR REPLICATION. FURTHER, WE PROPOSE THAT THE STRAIN 19 INDUCED UPR REGULATES CYTOKINE PRODUCTION. OUR SPECIFIC AIMS ARE TO DETERMINE WHETHER: 1) NLRP3 INFLAMMASOME ACTIVATION AND IL-1SS SECRETION INDUCED BY BRUCELLA REQUIRES THE UPR; 2) THE BACTERIAL VIRULENCE FACTOR SS TCPB THAT MODULATES HOST CELL MICROTUBULES ACTIVATES THE NLRP3 INFLAMMASOME AND IL-1SS AND 3) THE UPR ACTIVATED BY BRUCELLA ABORTUS STRAIN 19 REGULATES STING EXPRESSION AND TYPE I INTERFERON PRODUCTION TO FACILITATE BACTERIAL PERSISTENCE. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR APPROACH WILL SHED LIGHT ON THE MECHANISMS OF IMMUNITY AGAINST THIS IMPORTANT HUMAN AND ANIMAL PATHOGEN. ADDITIONALLY, CRITICAL INFORMATION GAINED FROM THESE SPECIFIC AIMS WILL BEGIN TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT MECHANISMS OF PROTECTION INDUCED BY B.

THERE IS AN INADEQUATE EVIDENCE BASE FOR SELECTING THE OPTIMAL TIMING FOR SURGERY, BUT A POSSIBLE CASE FOR UNDERTAKING SURGERY AT 6 MONTHS, RATHER THAN THE MORE USUAL TIMING OF 12 MONTHS OR LATER. PROVIDING A FUNCTIONING PALATE WHEN SPEECH SKILLS BEGIN TO DEVELOP MAY LEAD TO BETTER SPEECH OUTCOMES. OUR RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL COMPARING SURGERY AT 6 MONTHS OR 12 MONTHS IN INFANTS WITH ISOLATED NON-SYNDROMIC CLEFT PALATE (FUNDED BY NIDCR GRANTS 1U01DE018664 AND 1U01DE018837) BEGAN RECRUITMENT IN SEPTEMBER 2010. BY JUNE 2015, A TOTAL OF 650 INFANTS WILL HAVE BEEN RECRUITED ACROSS 23 CLEFT CENTRES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, SCANDINAVIA AND BRAZIL. FROM JULY 2015, OVER THE REMAINING 5 YEARS OF THE STUDY, WE WILL FOLLOW EVERY CHILD, OBTAIN STANDARDISED RECORDS AT AGE 12 MONTHS, 3 YEARS AND 5 YEARS, AND COMPARE A VARIETY OF OUTCOMES. THE MAIN OUTCOME WILL BE THE QUALITY OF SPEECH (RESONANCE, NASAL AIRFLOW) AS ASSESSED BY BLINDED LISTENERS. SECONDARY OUTCOMES WILL INCLUDE ARTICULATION, SURGICAL COMPLICATIONS, HEARING, GROWTH, AND DENTOFACIAL DEVELOPMENT. IF SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES ARE DEMONSTRATED, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IMPROVED KNOWLEDGE ABOUT OPTIMAL TIMING WILL IMPROVE SPEECH QUALITY, AND IN TURN, THE SOCIAL INTEGRATION OF AFFECTED CHILDREN, WHILE REDUCING THE BURDEN OF REMEDIAL CARE THAT THEY AND THEIR FAMILIES MUST ENDURE, AND THE ASSOCIATED MEDICAL COSTS. THE FINDINGS WILL BE APPLICABLE TO ANY COUNTRY WHERE CLEFT SURGERY CAN BE PLANNED IN ADVANCE.|2023-02-24|Department of Health and Human Services|National Institutes of Health|THE UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTER||UNITED KINGDOM|UNITED KINGDOM|||||||

TWO VACCINES ARE IN EARLY STAGE CLINICAL TRIALS AND BOTH TARGET DOMAINS WITHIN THE PROTEIN VAR2CSA, WHICH IS THE MAJOR SURFACE ANTIGEN EXPRESSED BY PLASMODIUM FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL ISOLATES. THIS PROTEIN BINDS TO RECEPTORS IN THE PLACENTA AND MEDIATES SEQUESTRATION OF INFECTED RED BLOOD CELLS (IRBCS), UNDERPINNING THE PATHOGENESIS OF PLACENTAL MALARIA. HOWEVER, VAR2CSA IS UNDER STRONG IMMUNE SELECTION AND IS HIGHLY POLYMORPHIC; THIS COMPROMISES VACCINE EFFICACY BY LIMITING THE BREADTH OF PROTECTION AGAINST DIVERSE ALLELES. POLYMORPHIC ANTIGENS PRESENT A UBIQUITOUS CHALLENGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MALARIA SUBUNIT VACCINES. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO A VACCINE AGAINST PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED MALARIA THAT TARGETS HIGHLY CONSERVED, SUBDOMINANT (EVEN CRYPTIC) EPITOPES. WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT THIS APPROACH IS THAT IT EXPLOITS A MECHANISM OF CROSS- SPECIES IMMUNITY, WHERE EPITOPES FROM ONE PLASMODIUM SPECIES ELICIT ROBUST, BROADLY NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES AGAINST STRUCTURALLY RELATED ANTIGENS FROM ANOTHER SPECIES. THIS MECHANISM WAS DISCOVERED RECENTLY IN COLOMBIAN AND BRAZILIAN POPULATIONS WHERE VAR2CSA ANTIBODIES CAN BE ACQUIRED OUTSIDE OF PREGNANCY FOLLOWING INFECTION WITH P. VIVAX, AND THESE ANTIBODIES BLOCKED SEQUESTRATION OF IRBCS USING IN VITRO CORRELATES OF PLACENTAL MALARIA. THE CROSS-REACTIVE EPITOPE IN P.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A VACCINE TO PROTECT PREGNANT WOMEN FROM FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL MALARIA THAT IS BASED ON THE CROSS- REACTIVE EPITOPE IN VIVAX SD1. THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH SYNTHESIS OF THREE COMPLEMENTARY SPECIFIC AIMS. EPITOPES REQUIRED TO ELICIT FUNCTIONAL, CROSS-REACTIVE ANTIBODIES WILL BE IDENTIFIED IN AIM 1 THROUGH CONFORMATIONALLY CONSTRICTED PEPTIDE MICROARRAYS SCREENED WITH MOUSE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES (MABS) AND HUMAN MABS TO SD1 ISOLATED FROM COLOMBIAN STUDY POPULATIONS. EPITOPES WILL BE SYNTHESIZED AS PEPTIDE- CONJUGATES OR WITHIN ENGINEERED RECOMBINANT DOMAINS, AND IMMUNOGENICITY WILL BE OPTIMIZED IN AIM 2 TO PRODUCE ANTIBODIES WITH FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY AGAINST PARASITES THAT EXPRESS DIVERSE ALLELES OF VAR2CSA. IN THE THIRD AIM, THE CRYPTIC EPITOPES IN VAR2CSA RECOGNIZED BY THESE ANTIBODIES WILL BE MAPPED TO IDENTIFY THE TARGETS OF ANTIBODIES ELICITED BY AN SD1-DERIVED VACCINE. THE INTEGRATION OF THESE FINDINGS WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT INSIGHT INTO THE MECHANISM OF CROSS-SPECIES EPITOPE RECOGNITION, WHICH WILL SERVE AS THE BASIS FOR A VIVAX VACCINE AGAINST FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL MALARIA AND COULD BE APPLIED MORE BROADLY TO VACCINES AGAINST OTHER MALARIA ANTIGENS.|EXPLOITING CROSS-REACTIVE, CONSERVED EPITOPES IN PLASMODIUM VIVAX TO DEVELOP A VACCINE AGAINST FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL MALARIA. - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A VACCINE IS URGENTLY NEEDED TO PROTECT PREGNANT WOMEN FROM MALARIA INFECTION AND THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF THIS DISEASE ON MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH.

TST MEASURES AN IN VIVO CELLULAR REACTION MEDIATED BY TH1 CELLS AT THE SITE OF TUBERCULIN INJECTION. ALTHOUGH TST DETECTS PREVIOUS EXPOSURE TO MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS (MTB), IT PRESENTS LOW SPECIFICITY AND IS NOT CAPABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE LATENT INFECTION FROM ACTIVE TB DISEASE. FEW YEARS AGO, THE IDENTIFICATION OF HIGHLY SPECIFIC RD1 REGION IN MTB GENOME DROVE THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW IN VITRO TB SPECIFIC TESTS. THE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE QUANTIFERON(R) TB GOLD IN TUBE6 IS AN EXAMPLE OF SUCH IN VITRO TESTS (ALSO KNOWN AS IGRA). IGRA DETECTS IFN- RELEASED FROM LYMPHOCYTES AFTER IN VITRO INCUBATION WITH MTB ANTIGENS. AS OPPOSED TO TST, IGRA OFFER ENHANCED SPECIFICITY AND ARE NOT INFLUENCED BY CROSS-REACTIVITY TO BCG AND OTHER NON-TUBERCULOUS MYCOBACTERIA (NTM). HOWEVER, IT IS STILL CONTROVERSIAL WHETHER IGRA CAN REPLACE TST AS THE DIAGNOSTIC TEST OF CHOICE. ALTHOUGH IGRA IS, BY DEFINITION, MORE SPECIFIC THAN TST, SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE REPORTED AN ELEVATED FREQUENCY OF IGRA REVERSIONS AND CONVERSIONS7-15 AS WELL AS DISCORDANCE BETWEEN IGRA AND TST 4, 16, 17. WE, RECENTLY, REPORTED A HIGH DISCORDANCE RATE (21%) BETWEEN THE TWO TESTS, WITH THE MAJORITY OF DISCORDANCE COMING FROM HHC WITH TST POSITIVE AND IGRA NEGATIVE RESULTS. THESE FINDINGS18 ALLOW US TO DIFFERENTIATE MTB-EXPOSED INDIVIDUALS FROM UNINFECTED (TST NEGATIVE, IGRA NEGATIVE), NEW INFECTION (TST POSITIVE/CONVERTED, IGRA NEGATIVE) AND REMOTE INFECTION (TST AND IGRA POSITIVE).

THE KNOWLEDGE GAINED WITH THIS PROPOSAL WILL HELP WITH THE ELUCIDATION OF IMMUNOLOGICAL BASIS OF TST/IGRA DISCORDANCE, WHICH IN TURN MAY ALLOW THE IMPROVEMENT OF IN-VITRO TB DIAGNOSTICS.

BRUCELLA ABORTUS STRAIN 19 VACCINE, DEVELOPED IN THE 1930S, IS THE PRINCIPAL VACCINE USED TO PREVENT TRANSMISSION OF BRUCELLOSIS FROM CATTLE TO HUMANS WORLDWIDE AND IN BRAZIL. THE MECHANISMS THAT MEDIATE PROTECTION BY STRAIN 19 ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD. HOST MECHANISMS OF INNATE IMMUNITY INDUCED BY THE VACCINE THAT CONTROL INFECTION REMAIN OBSCURE. INDEED, THE VACCINE CONTAINS SEVERAL PROPERTIES THAT ARE INHIBITORY TO HOST IMMUNITY. OUR RESEARCH GROUP WAS THE FIRST TO IMPLICATE THE ROLE OF INFLAMMASOME RECEPTORS IN THE CONTROL OF BRUCELLA ABORTUS INFECTION. FURTHER, OUR TEAM HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT IFN-ASSR KO MICE ARE MORE RESISTANT TO INFECTION SUGGESTING THAT TYPE I IFN SIGNALING FAVORS BRUCELLA MULTIPLICATION IN THE HOST. THEREFORE, OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO RESOLVE THE CONUNDRUM OF HOW BRUCELLA ACTIVATES INNATE IMMUNE COMPONENTS THAT RESULTS IN HOST RESISTANCE VERSUS BACTERIAL SUBVERSION OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE. BRUCELLA SPP ARE ONE OF THE FEW BACTERIAL PATHOGENS THAT USE THE ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM (ER) AS ITS REPLICATIVE NICHE. THE UNFOLDED PROTEIN RESPONSE (UPR) IS A CONSERVED SIGNALING PATHWAY IN EUKARYOTES THAT MEDIATES CELLULAR ADAPTATION TO PROTEIN-FOLDING STRESS IN THE ER. THE UPR ALSO MODULATES INNATE IMMUNITY.

THIS COMBINATION THERAPY DEMONSTRATED VERY HIGH EFFICACY IN CLINICAL TRIALS AND ACQUIRED DRUG RESISTANCE WAS ABSENT (FIRST-LINE TREATMENT) OR VERY RARE (SECOND-LINE TREATMENT). IT REMAINS TO BE DETERMINED WHETHER THIS HIGH EFFICACY AND LACK OF RESISTANCE DEVELOPMENT CAN BE EXTRAPOLATED TO TREATMENT OF NON-B SUBTYPE VIRUSES IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES WHERE MOST PLWH LIVE. OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO PROVIDE A SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR OPTIMAL LARGE-SCALE AND LONG-TERM TREATMENT OF PLWH WITH DTG. OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT NOVEL VIRAL MUTATIONS IN AND OUTSIDE THE INTEGRASE GENE (WITH AN EMPHASIS ON 3’-POLYPURINE TRACT CHANGES) CONTRIBUTE TO VIROLOGIC FAILURE WITH DTG IN CLINICAL PRACTICE. THIS HYPOTHESIS WILL BE TESTED BY IDENTIFYING PLWH FAILING DTG CONTAINING REGIMENS IN BRAZIL WHICH IS A MODEL COUNTRY FOR LARGE-SCALE DTG IMPLEMENTATION WHERE VARIOUS HIV SUBTYPES CO-CIRCULATE. SUBSEQUENTLY WE WILL PERFORM IN-DEPTH IN VITRO CHARACTERIZATIONS OF NOVEL VIRAL MUTATIONS IN AND OUTSIDE INTEGRASE GENE IN AN HIV SUBTYPE COMPARATIVE MANNER. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE: 1) TO CHARACTERIZE THE PATTERN OF INSTI RESISTANCE MUTATIONS THAT EMERGE DURING FAILURE OF DTG-CONTAINING CART IN INDIVIDUALS INFECTED WITH SUBTYPES C, F, AND BF RECOMBINANT FORMS IN BRAZIL. THESE ARE THE MOST PREVALENT NON-B SUBTYPES ON THE SOUTH-AMERICAN CONTINENT. 2) TO DETERMINE WHICH CHANGES IN THE 3’-PPT ARE OBSERVED IN VIRUSES FROM DTG FAILING INDIVIDUALS. RESULTS OF THIS STUDY WILL SHOW IF THIS NOVEL RESISTANCE PATHWAY CONTRIBUTES TO ACQUIRED DRUG RESISTANCE IN CLINICAL PRACTICE. 3) TO DETERMINE THE PHENOTYPIC CONSEQUENCES OF MUTATIONS IDENTIFIED IN SPECIFIC AIMS 1 AND 2. THESE STUDIES ASSESS AND COMPARE THE EFFECT OF NOVEL VIRAL MUTATIONS ON INSTI SUSCEPTIBILITY AND VIRAL FITNESS IN HIV SUBTYPES A, B, C, AND F IN VITRO (REPRESENTING 70% OF ALL INFECTIONS WORLDWIDE), AND THE MOLECULAR MECHANISM OF 3’-PPT MEDIATED INSTI RESISTANCE WILL BE DETERMINED.

TWO VACCINES ARE IN EARLY STAGE CLINICAL TRIALS AND BOTH TARGET DOMAINS WITHIN THE PROTEIN VAR2CSA, WHICH IS THE MAJOR SURFACE ANTIGEN EXPRESSED BY PLASMODIUM FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL ISOLATES. THIS PROTEIN BINDS TO RECEPTORS IN THE PLACENTA AND MEDIATES SEQUESTRATION OF INFECTED RED BLOOD CELLS (IRBCS), UNDERPINNING THE PATHOGENESIS OF PLACENTAL MALARIA. HOWEVER, VAR2CSA IS UNDER STRONG IMMUNE SELECTION AND IS HIGHLY POLYMORPHIC; THIS COMPROMISES VACCINE EFFICACY BY LIMITING THE BREADTH OF PROTECTION AGAINST DIVERSE ALLELES. POLYMORPHIC ANTIGENS PRESENT A UBIQUITOUS CHALLENGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MALARIA SUBUNIT VACCINES. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO A VACCINE AGAINST PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED MALARIA THAT TARGETS HIGHLY CONSERVED, SUBDOMINANT (EVEN CRYPTIC) EPITOPES. WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT THIS APPROACH IS THAT IT EXPLOITS A MECHANISM OF CROSS- SPECIES IMMUNITY, WHERE EPITOPES FROM ONE PLASMODIUM SPECIES ELICIT ROBUST, BROADLY NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES AGAINST STRUCTURALLY RELATED ANTIGENS FROM ANOTHER SPECIES. THIS MECHANISM WAS DISCOVERED RECENTLY IN COLOMBIAN AND BRAZILIAN POPULATIONS WHERE VAR2CSA ANTIBODIES CAN BE ACQUIRED OUTSIDE OF PREGNANCY FOLLOWING INFECTION WITH P. VIVAX, AND THESE ANTIBODIES BLOCKED SEQUESTRATION OF IRBCS USING IN VITRO CORRELATES OF PLACENTAL MALARIA. THE CROSS-REACTIVE EPITOPE IN P. VIVAX WAS MAPPED TO SUBDOMAIN (SD1) IN PVDBP AND HUMAN SD1-PURIFIED ANTIBODIES BLOCKED PARASITE ADHESION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A VACCINE TO PROTECT PREGNANT WOMEN FROM FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL MALARIA THAT IS BASED ON THE CROSS- REACTIVE EPITOPE IN VIVAX SD1. THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH SYNTHESIS OF THREE COMPLEMENTARY SPECIFIC AIMS. EPITOPES REQUIRED TO ELICIT FUNCTIONAL, CROSS-REACTIVE ANTIBODIES WILL BE IDENTIFIED IN AIM 1 THROUGH CONFORMATIONALLY CONSTRICTED PEPTIDE MICROARRAYS SCREENED WITH MOUSE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES (MABS) AND HUMAN MABS TO SD1 ISOLATED FROM COLOMBIAN STUDY POPULATIONS. EPITOPES WILL BE SYNTHESIZED AS PEPTIDE- CONJUGATES OR WITHIN ENGINEERED RECOMBINANT DOMAINS, AND IMMUNOGENICITY WILL BE OPTIMIZED IN AIM 2 TO PRODUCE ANTIBODIES WITH FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY AGAINST PARASITES THAT EXPRESS DIVERSE ALLELES OF VAR2CSA. IN THE THIRD AIM, THE CRYPTIC EPITOPES IN VAR2CSA RECOGNIZED BY THESE ANTIBODIES WILL BE MAPPED TO IDENTIFY THE TARGETS OF ANTIBODIES ELICITED BY AN SD1-DERIVED VACCINE. THE INTEGRATION OF THESE FINDINGS WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT INSIGHT INTO THE MECHANISM OF CROSS-SPECIES EPITOPE RECOGNITION, WHICH WILL SERVE AS THE BASIS FOR A VIVAX VACCINE AGAINST FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL MALARIA AND COULD BE APPLIED MORE BROADLY TO VACCINES AGAINST OTHER MALARIA ANTIGENS.|EXPLOITING CROSS-REACTIVE, CONSERVED EPITOPES IN PLASMODIUM VIVAX TO DEVELOP A VACCINE AGAINST FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL MALARIA. - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A VACCINE IS URGENTLY NEEDED TO PROTECT PREGNANT WOMEN FROM MALARIA INFECTION AND THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF THIS DISEASE ON MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH.

ADDITIONALLY, IN 19S6 WE REPORTED A NEW CLINICAL FORM OF LEISHMANIASIS CALLED DISSEMINATED LEISHMANIASIS (DL). DL IS DEFINED BY THE SUDDEN DEVELOPMENT OF A FEBRILE ILLNESS IN AN INDIVIDUAL WITH A PRIMARY ULCER AND THE APPEARANCE OF 10 AND UP TO 1000 ACNEIFORM PAPULES AND ULCERATED LESIONS SPANNING THE WHOLE BODY. DL IS OF GROWING CONCERN BECAUSE OF THE INCREASING NUMBER OF CASES IN THE LAST 20 YEARS, FROM 0.2% TO 4% IN NORTHEASTERN BRAZIL, THE PRESENCE OF A LARGE NUMBER OF LESIONS, THE OCCURRENCE OF MUCOSAL DISEASE IN UP TO 40% OF THE PATIENTS, AND A HIGH RATE OF FAILURE TO THERAPY. L. BRAZILIENSIS IS POLYMORPHIC AND ISOLATES THAT CAUSE DL HAVE GENOTYPIC CHARACTERISTICS DIFFERENT FROM CL AND ML. ADDITIONALLY PARASITES ISOLATED FROM DL INDUCE HIGHER PRODUCTION OF PRO- INFLAMMATORY CHEMOKINES AND TNF IN MACROPHAGES THAN CL ISOLATES. THE HISTOPATHOLOGIC FINDINGS IN DL ARE SIMILAR TO CL WITH FEW PARASITES, LYMPHOCYTE INFILTRATION AND GRANULOMA FORMATION. MOREOVER WE HAVE NOT DETECTED ANY IMPAIRMENT OF MACROPHAGES IN LEISHMANIA KILLING AND NO IMPAIRMENT IN T CELLS RESPONSE IN DL. IN CONTRAST MACROPHAGES FROM DL PRODUCE HIGHER LEVELS OF TNF, CXCL9 AND CXCL 1O THAN CL CELLS. WE HAVE ALSO DEMONSTRATED THAT CDS CYTOLYTIC T CELLS MEDIATE INCREASED PATHOLOGY IN CL PATIENTS AND METASTASIS IN L. BRAZI/IENSIS INFECTION. IT IS KNOWN THAT INFLAMMATION PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN METASTASIS IN CANCER. OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT AN EXAGGERATED INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE MEDIATED BY MACROPHAGES AND CDS T CELLS LEADS TO METASTASIS AND PATHOLOGY IN DL. IN AIM1 OF THIS PROJECT, WE WILL DETERMINE THE HOST AND PARASITE FACTORS THAT LEAD TO DL, AND BASED UPON THIS KNOWLEDGE PROPOSE NEW AND EFFECTIVE METHODS OF TREATMENT. IN AIM1 WE WILL CHARACTERIZE PARASITE AND VECTOR FACTORS IN DL. WE WILL DETERMINE IF PARASITES FROM PRIMARY ULCER DIFFER FROM THOSE OF METASTASIS LESIONS, AND IF PARASITES FROM PATIENTS WITH 10-12 LESIONS DIFFER FROM THESE OBTAINED FROM PATIENTS WITH MORE THAN 5 LESIONS. WE WILL ALSO DETERMINE IF PHLEBOTOMIES SPECIES IN THE AREA OF CASES OF DL WILL BE DIFFERENT FROM SANDFLIES ISOLATED FROM THE ENVIRONMENT OF PATIENTS WITH CL. IN THE AIM 2 WE WILL ASSESS THE CONTRIBUTION OF MONOCYTES AND MACROPHAGES TO THE EXAGGERATED INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE AND METASTASIS OF L. BRAZILIENSIS INFECTED CELLS. IN THE AIM 3 WE WILL DEFINE THE PARTICIPATION OF CDS+ T CELLS IN THE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE AND METASTASIS OBSERVED IN DL INFECTED CELLS.|INFLAMMATION IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF DISSEMINATED LEISHMANIASIS - LEISHMANIA BRAZILIENSIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CAUSAL AGENT OF CUTANEOUS LEISHMANIASIS (CL) AND MUCOSAL LEISHMANIASIS (ML) IN SOUTH AMERICAN. ADDITIONALLY, IN 19S6 WE REPORTED A NEW CLINICAL FORM OF LEISHMANIASIS CALLED DISSEMINATED LEISHMANIASIS (DL). DL IS DEFINED BY THE SUDDEN DEVELOPMENT OF A FEBRILE ILLNESS IN AN INDIVIDUAL WITH A PRIMARY ULCER AND THE APPEARANCE OF 10 AND UP TO 1000 ACNEIFORM PAPULES AND ULCERATED LESIONS SPANNING THE WHOLE BODY. DL IS OF GROWING CONCERN BECAUSE OF THE INCREASING NUMBER OF CASES IN THE LAST 20 YEARS, FROM 0.2% TO 4% IN NORTHEASTERN BRAZIL, THE PRESENCE OF A LARGE NUMBER OF LESIONS, THE OCCURRENCE OF MUCOSAL DISEASE IN UP TO 40% OF THE PATIENTS, AND A HIGH RATE OF FAILURE TO THERAPY. L. BRAZILIENSIS IS POLYMORPHIC AND ISOLATES THAT CAUSE DL HAVE GENOTYPIC CHARACTERISTICS DIFFERENT FROM CL AND ML. ADDITIONALLY PARASITES ISOLATED FROM DL INDUCE HIGHER PRODUCTION OF PRO- INFLAMMATORY CHEMOKINES AND TNF IN MACROPHAGES THAN CL ISOLATES. THE HISTOPATHOLOGIC FINDINGS IN DL ARE SIMILAR TO CL WITH FEW PARASITES, LYMPHOCYTE INFILTRATION AND GRANULOMA FORMATION. MOREOVER WE HAVE NOT DETECTED ANY IMPAIRMENT OF MACROPHAGES IN LEISHMANIA KILLING AND NO IMPAIRMENT IN T CELLS RESPONSE IN DL. IN CONTRAST MACROPHAGES FROM DL PRODUCE HIGHER LEVELS OF TNF, CXCL9 AND CXCL 1O THAN CL CELLS. WE HAVE ALSO DEMONSTRATED THAT CDS CYTOLYTIC T CELLS MEDIATE INCREASED PATHOLOGY IN CL PATIENTS AND METASTASIS IN L. BRAZI/IENSIS INFECTION. IT IS KNOWN THAT INFLAMMATION PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN METASTASIS IN CANCER. OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT AN EXAGGERATED INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE MEDIATED BY MACROPHAGES AND CDS T CELLS LEADS TO METASTASIS AND PATHOLOGY IN DL. IN AIM1 OF THIS PROJECT, WE WILL DETERMINE THE HOST AND PARASITE FACTORS THAT LEAD TO DL, AND BASED UPON THIS KNOWLEDGE PROPOSE NEW AND EFFECTIVE METHODS OF TREATMENT. IN AIM1 WE WILL CHARACTERIZE PARASITE AND VECTOR FACTORS IN DL. WE WILL DETERMINE IF PARASITES FROM PRIMARY ULCER DIFFER FROM THOSE OF METASTASIS LESIONS, AND IF PARASITES FROM PATIENTS WITH 10-12 LESIONS DIFFER FROM THESE OBTAINED FROM PATIENTS WITH MORE THAN 5 LESIONS. WE WILL ALSO DETERMINE IF PHLEBOTOMIES SPECIES IN THE AREA OF CASES OF DL WILL BE DIFFERENT FROM SANDFLIES ISOLATED FROM THE ENVIRONMENT OF PATIENTS WITH CL. IN THE AIM 2 WE WILL ASSESS THE CONTRIBUTION OF MONOCYTES AND MACROPHAGES TO THE EXAGGERATED INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE AND METASTASIS OF L. BRAZILIENSIS INFECTED CELLS. IN THE AIM 3 WE WILL DEFINE THE PARTICIPATION OF CDS+ T CELLS IN THE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE AND METASTASIS OBSERVED IN DL INFECTED CELLS.|2021-05-20|Department of Health and Human Services|National Institutes of Health|FUNDACAO DE APOIO A PESQUISA E A EXTENSAO|FUNDACAO DE APOIO A PESQUISA E A EXTENSAO|BRAZIL|BRAZIL|||||||

THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE INDIVIDUALS EXPOSED TO M. LEPRAE BECOMES INFECTED, BUT ONLY A SMALL PROPORTION OF THE INFECTED INDIVIDUALS EVOLVES TO ACTIVE DISEASE. PREVIOUS WORK IN LEPROSY AND TUBERCULOSIS DEMONSTRATED A MAJOR ROLE OF INTERFERON-, AN EFFECTOR CYTOKINE PRODUCED BY PATHOGEN-SPECIFIC MEMORY CD4 T CELLS, IN THE CONTROL OF THE INFECTION BY THESE INTRACELLULAR PATHOGENS. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA SHOW A PROGRESSIVE REDUCTION IN M. LEPRAE-SPECIFIC IFN LEVELS IN INDIVIDUALS THAT CORRELATES TO INDICATORS OF LEVEL OF EXPOSURE TO M. LEPRAE AND TO BACILLARY LOAD IN INDIVIDUALS WITH LEPROSY. WHEN WE EVALUATED THE INTERACTION OF M. LEPRAE WITH SCHWANN CELLS AND MONONUCLEAR PHAGOCYTES, WE OBSERVED AN INDUCTION OF THE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINE IL-10 AND THE LIPID MEDIATOR PGE-2. METABOLOMICS ANALYSES OF LESIONS AND SERA FROM LEPROSY PATIENTS ALSO DEMONSTRATED CLEAR DIFFERENCES IN THE PRESENCE OF POLYUNSATURATED FATTY ACID (PUFA) DERIVED LIPID MEDIATORS THAT CORRELATED TO THE CLINICAL FORMS OF LEPROSY AND BACILLARY LOADS.

TWO VACCINES ARE IN EARLY STAGE CLINICAL TRIALS AND BOTH TARGET DOMAINS WITHIN THE PROTEIN VAR2CSA, WHICH IS THE MAJOR SURFACE ANTIGEN EXPRESSED BY PLASMODIUM FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL ISOLATES. THIS PROTEIN BINDS TO RECEPTORS IN THE PLACENTA AND MEDIATES SEQUESTRATION OF INFECTED RED BLOOD CELLS (IRBCS), UNDERPINNING THE PATHOGENESIS OF PLACENTAL MALARIA. HOWEVER, VAR2CSA IS UNDER STRONG IMMUNE SELECTION AND IS HIGHLY POLYMORPHIC; THIS COMPROMISES VACCINE EFFICACY BY LIMITING THE BREADTH OF PROTECTION AGAINST DIVERSE ALLELES. POLYMORPHIC ANTIGENS PRESENT A UBIQUITOUS CHALLENGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MALARIA SUBUNIT VACCINES. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO A VACCINE AGAINST PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED MALARIA THAT TARGETS HIGHLY CONSERVED, SUBDOMINANT (EVEN CRYPTIC) EPITOPES. WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT THIS APPROACH IS THAT IT EXPLOITS A MECHANISM OF CROSS- SPECIES IMMUNITY, WHERE EPITOPES FROM ONE PLASMODIUM SPECIES ELICIT ROBUST, BROADLY NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES AGAINST STRUCTURALLY RELATED ANTIGENS FROM ANOTHER SPECIES. THIS MECHANISM WAS DISCOVERED RECENTLY IN COLOMBIAN AND BRAZILIAN POPULATIONS WHERE VAR2CSA ANTIBODIES CAN BE ACQUIRED OUTSIDE OF PREGNANCY FOLLOWING INFECTION WITH P. VIVAX, AND THESE ANTIBODIES BLOCKED SEQUESTRATION OF IRBCS USING IN VITRO CORRELATES OF PLACENTAL MALARIA. THE CROSS-REACTIVE EPITOPE IN P. VIVAX WAS MAPPED TO SUBDOMAIN (SD1) IN PVDBP AND HUMAN SD1-PURIFIED ANTIBODIES BLOCKED PARASITE ADHESION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A VACCINE TO PROTECT PREGNANT WOMEN FROM FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL MALARIA THAT IS BASED ON THE CROSS- REACTIVE EPITOPE IN VIVAX SD1. THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH SYNTHESIS OF THREE COMPLEMENTARY SPECIFIC AIMS. EPITOPES REQUIRED TO ELICIT FUNCTIONAL, CROSS-REACTIVE ANTIBODIES WILL BE IDENTIFIED IN AIM 1 THROUGH CONFORMATIONALLY CONSTRICTED PEPTIDE MICROARRAYS SCREENED WITH MOUSE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES (MABS) AND HUMAN MABS TO SD1 ISOLATED FROM COLOMBIAN STUDY POPULATIONS. EPITOPES WILL BE SYNTHESIZED AS PEPTIDE- CONJUGATES OR WITHIN ENGINEERED RECOMBINANT DOMAINS, AND IMMUNOGENICITY WILL BE OPTIMIZED IN AIM 2 TO PRODUCE ANTIBODIES WITH FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY AGAINST PARASITES THAT EXPRESS DIVERSE ALLELES OF VAR2CSA. IN THE THIRD AIM, THE CRYPTIC EPITOPES IN VAR2CSA RECOGNIZED BY THESE ANTIBODIES WILL BE MAPPED TO IDENTIFY THE TARGETS OF ANTIBODIES ELICITED BY AN SD1-DERIVED VACCINE. THE INTEGRATION OF THESE FINDINGS WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT INSIGHT INTO THE MECHANISM OF CROSS-SPECIES EPITOPE RECOGNITION, WHICH WILL SERVE AS THE BASIS FOR A VIVAX VACCINE AGAINST FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL MALARIA AND COULD BE APPLIED MORE BROADLY TO VACCINES AGAINST OTHER MALARIA ANTIGENS.|EXPLOITING CROSS-REACTIVE, CONSERVED EPITOPES IN PLASMODIUM VIVAX TO DEVELOP A VACCINE AGAINST FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL MALARIA. - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A VACCINE IS URGENTLY NEEDED TO PROTECT PREGNANT WOMEN FROM MALARIA INFECTION AND THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF THIS DISEASE ON MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH.

THEREFORE, OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO 15 RESOLVE THE BLACK BOX OF HOW BRUCELLA ACTIVATES INNATE IMMUNE COMPONENTS THAT 16 RESULTS IN HOST RESISTANCE VERSUS BACTERIAL SUBVERSION OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE. 17 BASED ON THESE COMPELLING PRELIMINARY DATA, WE PROPOSE TO TEST THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS 18 THAT BRUCELLA ABORTUS STRAIN 19 ACTIVATES PROTECTIVE INNATE IMMUNE MEDIATORS VIA 19 STING/GBP PATHWAY AND TRIGGERS THE UPR TO SECURE INTRACELLULAR REPLICATION. OUR 20 SPECIFIC AIMS ARE: 1) TO DEFINE WHICH STING-MEDIATED GUANYLATED-BINDING PROTEINS 21 (GBPS) ARE IMPORTANT TO RELEASE BACTERIAL DNA AND LPS INTO HOST CELLS TO ACTIVATE 22 INFLAMMASOME RECEPTORS; 2) TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE UNFOLDED PROTEIN 23 RESPONSE (UPR) INDUCED BY BRUCELLA REGULATES MACROPHAGE POLARIZATION TO 24 FACILITATE BACTERIAL PERSISTENCE; 3) TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 25 HIF-1Α-DEPENDENT METABOLIC CHANGES IN MACROPHAGES INDUCED BY BRUCELLA AFFECT 26 INFLAMMASOME ACTIVATION AND BACTERIAL CLEARANCE.

HOST  9 MECHANISMS OF INNATE IMMUNITY INDUCED BY THE VACCINE THAT CONTROL INFECTION REMAIN 10 OBSCURE. ADDITIONALLY, THE VACCINE CONTAINS SEVERAL PROPERTIES THAT ARE INHIBITORY TO HOST 11 IMMUNITY. WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT B. ABORTUS, BACTERIAL DNA AND LPS LEADS TO 12 INFLAMMASOME ACTIVATION VIA STING/GBP (GUANYLATE-BINDING PROTEIN) AXIS THAT LIMITS 13 BRUCELLA REPLICATION. IN CONTRAST, B. ABORTUS INDUCES THE UNFOLDED PROTEIN RESPONSE 14 (UPR) THAT FAVORS BRUCELLA SURVIVAL IN THE HOST. THEREFORE, OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO 15 RESOLVE THE BLACK BOX OF HOW BRUCELLA ACTIVATES INNATE IMMUNE COMPONENTS THAT 16 RESULTS IN HOST RESISTANCE VERSUS BACTERIAL SUBVERSION OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE. 17 BASED ON THESE COMPELLING PRELIMINARY DATA, WE PROPOSE TO TEST THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS 18 THAT BRUCELLA ABORTUS STRAIN 19 ACTIVATES PROTECTIVE INNATE IMMUNE MEDIATORS VIA 19 STING/GBP PATHWAY AND TRIGGERS THE UPR TO SECURE INTRACELLULAR REPLICATION. OUR 20 SPECIFIC AIMS ARE: 1) TO DEFINE WHICH STING-MEDIATED GUANYLATED-BINDING PROTEINS 21 (GBPS) ARE IMPORTANT TO RELEASE BACTERIAL DNA AND LPS INTO HOST CELLS TO ACTIVATE 22 INFLAMMASOME RECEPTORS; 2) TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE UNFOLDED PROTEIN 23 RESPONSE (UPR) INDUCED BY BRUCELLA REGULATES MACROPHAGE POLARIZATION TO 24 FACILITATE BACTERIAL PERSISTENCE; 3) TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 25 HIF-1Α-DEPENDENT METABOLIC CHANGES IN MACROPHAGES INDUCED BY BRUCELLA AFFECT 26 INFLAMMASOME ACTIVATION AND BACTERIAL CLEARANCE. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR APPROACH WILL 27 SHED LIGHT ON THE MECHANISMS OF IMMUNITY AND/OR PATHOGENESIS OF THIS IMPORTANT 28 HUMAN AND ANIMAL PATHOGEN.

THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE INDIVIDUALS EXPOSED TO M. LEPRAE BECOMES INFECTED, BUT ONLY A SMALL PROPORTION OF THE INFECTED INDIVIDUALS EVOLVES TO ACTIVE DISEASE. PREVIOUS WORK IN LEPROSY AND TUBERCULOSIS DEMONSTRATED A MAJOR ROLE OF INTERFERON-Γ, AN EFFECTOR CYTOKINE PRODUCED BY PATHOGEN-SPECIFIC MEMORY CD4 T CELLS, IN THE CONTROL OF THE INFECTION BY THESE INTRACELLULAR PATHOGENS. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA SHOW A PROGRESSIVE REDUCTION IN M. LEPRAE-SPECIFIC IFNΓ LEVELS IN INDIVIDUALS THAT CORRELATES TO INDICATORS OF LEVEL OF EXPOSURE TO M. LEPRAE AND TO BACILLARY LOAD IN INDIVIDUALS WITH LEPROSY. WHEN WE EVALUATED THE INTERACTION OF M. LEPRAE WITH SCHWANN CELLS AND MONONUCLEAR PHAGOCYTES, WE OBSERVED AN INDUCTION OF THE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINE IL-10 AND THE LIPID MEDIATOR PGE-2. METABOLOMICS ANALYSES OF LESIONS AND SERA FROM LEPROSY PATIENTS ALSO DEMONSTRATED CLEAR DIFFERENCES IN THE PRESENCE OF POLYUNSATURATED FATTY ACID (PUFA) DERIVED LIPID MEDIATORS THAT CORRELATED TO THE CLINICAL FORMS OF LEPROSY AND BACILLARY LOADS.

TWO VACCINES ARE IN EARLY STAGE CLINICAL TRIALS AND BOTH TARGET DOMAINS WITHIN THE PROTEIN VAR2CSA, WHICH IS THE MAJOR SURFACE ANTIGEN EXPRESSED BY PLASMODIUM FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL ISOLATES. THIS PROTEIN BINDS TO RECEPTORS IN THE PLACENTA AND MEDIATES SEQUESTRATION OF INFECTED RED BLOOD CELLS (IRBCS), UNDERPINNING THE PATHOGENESIS OF PLACENTAL MALARIA. HOWEVER, VAR2CSA IS UNDER STRONG IMMUNE SELECTION AND IS HIGHLY POLYMORPHIC; THIS COMPROMISES VACCINE EFFICACY BY LIMITING THE BREADTH OF PROTECTION AGAINST DIVERSE ALLELES. POLYMORPHIC ANTIGENS PRESENT A UBIQUITOUS CHALLENGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MALARIA SUBUNIT VACCINES. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO A VACCINE AGAINST PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED MALARIA THAT TARGETS HIGHLY CONSERVED, SUBDOMINANT (EVEN CRYPTIC) EPITOPES. WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT THIS APPROACH IS THAT IT EXPLOITS A MECHANISM OF CROSS- SPECIES IMMUNITY, WHERE EPITOPES FROM ONE PLASMODIUM SPECIES ELICIT ROBUST, BROADLY NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES AGAINST STRUCTURALLY RELATED ANTIGENS FROM ANOTHER SPECIES. THIS MECHANISM WAS DISCOVERED RECENTLY IN COLOMBIAN AND BRAZILIAN POPULATIONS WHERE VAR2CSA ANTIBODIES CAN BE ACQUIRED OUTSIDE OF PREGNANCY FOLLOWING INFECTION WITH P. VIVAX, AND THESE ANTIBODIES BLOCKED SEQUESTRATION OF IRBCS USING IN VITRO CORRELATES OF PLACENTAL MALARIA. THE CROSS-REACTIVE EPITOPE IN P. VIVAX WAS MAPPED TO SUBDOMAIN (SD1) IN PVDBP AND HUMAN SD1-PURIFIED ANTIBODIES BLOCKED PARASITE ADHESION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A VACCINE TO PROTECT PREGNANT WOMEN FROM FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL MALARIA THAT IS BASED ON THE CROSS- REACTIVE EPITOPE IN VIVAX SD1. THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH SYNTHESIS OF THREE COMPLEMENTARY SPECIFIC AIMS. EPITOPES REQUIRED TO ELICIT FUNCTIONAL, CROSS-REACTIVE ANTIBODIES WILL BE IDENTIFIED IN AIM 1 THROUGH CONFORMATIONALLY CONSTRICTED PEPTIDE MICROARRAYS SCREENED WITH MOUSE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES (MABS) AND HUMAN MABS TO SD1 ISOLATED FROM COLOMBIAN STUDY POPULATIONS. EPITOPES WILL BE SYNTHESIZED AS PEPTIDE- CONJUGATES OR WITHIN ENGINEERED RECOMBINANT DOMAINS, AND IMMUNOGENICITY WILL BE OPTIMIZED IN AIM 2 TO PRODUCE ANTIBODIES WITH FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY AGAINST PARASITES THAT EXPRESS DIVERSE ALLELES OF VAR2CSA. IN THE THIRD AIM, THE CRYPTIC EPITOPES IN VAR2CSA RECOGNIZED BY THESE ANTIBODIES WILL BE MAPPED TO IDENTIFY THE TARGETS OF ANTIBODIES ELICITED BY AN SD1-DERIVED VACCINE. THE INTEGRATION OF THESE FINDINGS WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT INSIGHT INTO THE MECHANISM OF CROSS-SPECIES EPITOPE RECOGNITION, WHICH WILL SERVE AS THE BASIS FOR A VIVAX VACCINE AGAINST FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL MALARIA AND COULD BE APPLIED MORE BROADLY TO VACCINES AGAINST OTHER MALARIA ANTIGENS.|EXPLOITING CROSS-REACTIVE, CONSERVED EPITOPES IN PLASMODIUM VIVAX TO DEVELOP A VACCINE AGAINST FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL MALARIA. - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A VACCINE IS URGENTLY NEEDED TO PROTECT PREGNANT WOMEN FROM MALARIA INFECTION AND THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF THIS DISEASE ON MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH.

BRUCELLA ABORTUS STRAIN 19 VACCINE, DEVELOPED IN THE 1930S, IS THE PRINCIPAL VACCINE USED TO PREVENT TRANSMISSION OF BRUCELLOSIS FROM CATTLE TO HUMANS WORLDWIDE AND IN BRAZIL. THE MECHANISMS THAT MEDIATE PROTECTION BY STRAIN 19 ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD. HOST MECHANISMS OF INNATE IMMUNITY INDUCED BY THE VACCINE THAT CONTROL INFECTION REMAIN OBSCURE. INDEED, THE VACCINE CONTAINS SEVERAL PROPERTIES THAT ARE INHIBITORY TO HOST IMMUNITY. OUR RESEARCH GROUP WAS THE FIRST TO IMPLICATE THE ROLE OF INFLAMMASOME RECEPTORS IN THE CONTROL OF BRUCELLA ABORTUS INFECTION. FURTHER, OUR TEAM HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT IFN-ASSR KO MICE ARE MORE RESISTANT TO INFECTION SUGGESTING THAT TYPE I IFN SIGNALING FAVORS BRUCELLA MULTIPLICATION IN THE HOST. THEREFORE, OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO RESOLVE THE CONUNDRUM OF HOW BRUCELLA ACTIVATES INNATE IMMUNE COMPONENTS THAT RESULTS IN HOST RESISTANCE VERSUS BACTERIAL SUBVERSION OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE. BRUCELLA SPP ARE ONE OF THE FEW BACTERIAL PATHOGENS THAT USE THE ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM (ER) AS ITS REPLICATIVE NICHE. THE UNFOLDED PROTEIN RESPONSE (UPR) IS A CONSERVED SIGNALING PATHWAY IN EUKARYOTES THAT MEDIATES CELLULAR ADAPTATION TO PROTEIN-FOLDING STRESS IN THE ER. THE UPR ALSO MODULATES INNATE IMMUNITY. RECENTLY, OUR COLLABORATORS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT BRUCELLA INDUCES THE UPR THAT ENABLES ITS INTRACELLULAR REPLICATION. BASED ON THESE COMPELLING PRELIMINARY DATA, WE PROPOSE TO TEST THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS THAT BRUCELLA ABORTUS STRAIN 19 ACTIVATES PROTECTIVE INNATE IMMUNE MEDIATORS AND TRIGGERS THE UPR TO SECURE INTRACELLULAR REPLICATION. FURTHER, WE PROPOSE THAT THE STRAIN 19 INDUCED UPR REGULATES CYTOKINE PRODUCTION. OUR SPECIFIC AIMS ARE TO DETERMINE WHETHER: 1) NLRP3 INFLAMMASOME ACTIVATION AND IL-1SS SECRETION INDUCED BY BRUCELLA REQUIRES THE UPR; 2) THE BACTERIAL VIRULENCE FACTOR SS TCPB THAT MODULATES HOST CELL MICROTUBULES ACTIVATES THE NLRP3 INFLAMMASOME AND IL-1SS AND 3) THE UPR ACTIVATED BY BRUCELLA ABORTUS STRAIN 19 REGULATES STING EXPRESSION AND TYPE I INTERFERON PRODUCTION TO FACILITATE BACTERIAL PERSISTENCE. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR APPROACH WILL SHED LIGHT ON THE MECHANISMS OF IMMUNITY AGAINST THIS IMPORTANT HUMAN AND ANIMAL PATHOGEN. ADDITIONALLY, CRITICAL INFORMATION GAINED FROM THESE SPECIFIC AIMS WILL BEGIN TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT MECHANISMS OF PROTECTION INDUCED BY B. ABORTUS VACCINE STRAIN 19 AND HOW BACTERIAL PERSISTENCE IS REGULATED. FINALLY, THE INVESTIGATORS ON THIS PROPOSAL HAVE A STRONG TRACK RECORD IN BRUCELLOSIS RESEARCH AND A UNIQUE COMBINATION OF KEY EXPERTISE IN WHOLE ANIMAL MODELS, IMMUNOLOGY, HUMAN BRUCELLOSIS, CELL BIOLOGY, AND ANALYSIS OF THE UPR.|BRUCELLA INDUCES STING-MEDIATED GUANYLATE-BINDING PROTEIN EXPRESSION AND UNFOLDED PROTEIN RESPONSE: BALANCING BACTERIAL ELIMINATION, INFLAMMATION AND DISEASE - DESCRIPTION (PROVIDED BY APPLICANT): BRUCELLOSIS IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST FREQUENT ZOONOTIC DISEASES WITH OVER 500,000 NEW HUMAN INFECTIONS EVERY YEAR. BRUCELLA ABORTUS STRAIN 19 VACCINE, DEVELOPED IN THE 1930S, IS THE PRINCIPAL VACCINE USED TO PREVENT TRANSMISSION OF BRUCELLOSIS FROM CATTLE TO HUMANS WORLDWIDE AND IN BRAZIL. THE MECHANISMS THAT MEDIATE PROTECTION BY STRAIN 19 ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD. HOST MECHANISMS OF INNATE IMMUNITY INDUCED BY THE VACCINE THAT CONTROL INFECTION REMAIN OBSCURE. INDEED, THE VACCINE CONTAINS SEVERAL PROPERTIES THAT ARE INHIBITORY TO HOST IMMUNITY. OUR RESEARCH GROUP WAS THE FIRST TO IMPLICATE THE ROLE OF INFLAMMASOME RECEPTORS IN THE CONTROL OF BRUCELLA ABORTUS INFECTION. FURTHER, OUR TEAM HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT IFN-ASSR KO MICE ARE MORE RESISTANT TO INFECTION SUGGESTING THAT TYPE I IFN SIGNALING FAVORS BRUCELLA MULTIPLICATION IN THE HOST. THEREFORE, OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO RESOLVE THE CONUNDRUM OF HOW BRUCELLA ACTIVATES INNATE IMMUNE COMPONENTS THAT RESULTS IN HOST RESISTANCE VERSUS BACTERIAL SUBVERSION OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE. BRUCELLA SPP ARE ONE OF THE FEW BACTERIAL PATHOGENS THAT USE THE ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM (ER) AS ITS REPLICATIVE NICHE. THE UNFOLDED PROTEIN RESPONSE (UPR) IS A CONSERVED SIGNALING PATHWAY IN EUKARYOTES THAT MEDIATES CELLULAR ADAPTATION TO PROTEIN-FOLDING STRESS IN THE ER. THE UPR ALSO MODULATES INNATE IMMUNITY. RECENTLY, OUR COLLABORATORS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT BRUCELLA INDUCES THE UPR THAT ENABLES ITS INTRACELLULAR REPLICATION. BASED ON THESE COMPELLING PRELIMINARY DATA, WE PROPOSE TO TEST THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS THAT BRUCELLA ABORTUS STRAIN 19 ACTIVATES PROTECTIVE INNATE IMMUNE MEDIATORS AND TRIGGERS THE UPR TO SECURE INTRACELLULAR REPLICATION.

THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE INDIVIDUALS EXPOSED TO M. LEPRAE BECOMES INFECTED, BUT ONLY A SMALL PROPORTION OF THE INFECTED INDIVIDUALS EVOLVES TO ACTIVE DISEASE. PREVIOUS WORK IN LEPROSY AND TUBERCULOSIS DEMONSTRATED A MAJOR ROLE OF INTERFERON-, AN EFFECTOR CYTOKINE PRODUCED BY PATHOGEN-SPECIFIC MEMORY CD4 T CELLS, IN THE CONTROL OF THE INFECTION BY THESE INTRACELLULAR PATHOGENS. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA SHOW A PROGRESSIVE REDUCTION IN M. LEPRAE-SPECIFIC IFN LEVELS IN INDIVIDUALS THAT CORRELATES TO INDICATORS OF LEVEL OF EXPOSURE TO M. LEPRAE AND TO BACILLARY LOAD IN INDIVIDUALS WITH LEPROSY. WHEN WE EVALUATED THE INTERACTION OF M. LEPRAE WITH SCHWANN CELLS AND MONONUCLEAR PHAGOCYTES, WE OBSERVED AN INDUCTION OF THE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINE IL-10 AND THE LIPID MEDIATOR PGE-2. METABOLOMICS ANALYSES OF LESIONS AND SERA FROM LEPROSY PATIENTS ALSO DEMONSTRATED CLEAR DIFFERENCES IN THE PRESENCE OF POLYUNSATURATED FATTY ACID (PUFA) DERIVED LIPID MEDIATORS THAT CORRELATED TO THE CLINICAL FORMS OF LEPROSY AND BACILLARY LOADS. OTHER INVESTIGATORS DETECTED FREQUENCIES OF FOXP-3 POSITIVE T CELLS IN THE BLOOD AND LESIONS OF LEPROSY PATIENTS THAT CORRELATE TO THE EXPECTED INHIBITION OF CELLULAR IMMUNITY AND EFFECTOR FUNCTION AGAINST M. LEPRAE IN THE MULTIBACILLARY FORMS OF LEPROSY. TAKING IN TO ACCOUNT THESE FINDINGS, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT M. LEPRAE INTERACTIONS WITH SCHWANN CELLS AND MONONUCLEAR PHAGOCYTES GENERATE A MICROENVIRONMENT VIA THE ACTIVITIES OF LIPID MEDIATOR THAT FACILITATES THE INHIBITION OF PATHOGEN-SPECIFIC IFN- RESPONSE BY TREG. WE WILL TEST THESE HYPOTHESES IN THE EXPERIMENTS OF THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS: 1-EVALUATE THE PHENOTYPE AND FUNCTIONALLY THE TREG PRESENT IN THE BLOOD AND SKIN LESIONS OF M. LEPRAE-INFECTED INDIVIDUALS AND LEPROSY PATIENTS, TO DEFINE THE ROLE OF TREG IN TH1 REGULATION DURING LEPROSY DISEASE. 2- INVESTIGATE SPECIFIC LIPID MEDIATORS OF INFLAMMATORY AND IMMUNE RESPONSES AND THEIR ALTERATION OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSES IN M. LEPRAE- INFECTED INDIVIDUALS. NEGATIVE REGULATION OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE ENTAILS SEVERAL DIFFERENT MECHANISMS THAT ARE PRESENT BUT LESS VISIBLE IN ASYMPTOMATIC INDIVIDUALS IN THE INITIAL STAGES OF THE SILENT, LONG-EVOLVING STEPS OF CHRONIC INFECTIONS, AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES, AND CANCER.

TWO VACCINES ARE IN EARLY STAGE CLINICAL TRIALS AND BOTH TARGET DOMAINS WITHIN THE PROTEIN VAR2CSA, WHICH IS THE MAJOR SURFACE ANTIGEN EXPRESSED BY PLASMODIUM FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL ISOLATES. THIS PROTEIN BINDS TO RECEPTORS IN THE PLACENTA AND MEDIATES SEQUESTRATION OF INFECTED RED BLOOD CELLS (IRBCS), UNDERPINNING THE PATHOGENESIS OF PLACENTAL MALARIA. HOWEVER, VAR2CSA IS UNDER STRONG IMMUNE SELECTION AND IS HIGHLY POLYMORPHIC; THIS COMPROMISES VACCINE EFFICACY BY LIMITING THE BREADTH OF PROTECTION AGAINST DIVERSE ALLELES. POLYMORPHIC ANTIGENS PRESENT A UBIQUITOUS CHALLENGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MALARIA SUBUNIT VACCINES. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO A VACCINE AGAINST PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED MALARIA THAT TARGETS HIGHLY CONSERVED, SUBDOMINANT (EVEN CRYPTIC) EPITOPES. WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT THIS APPROACH IS THAT IT EXPLOITS A MECHANISM OF CROSS- SPECIES IMMUNITY, WHERE EPITOPES FROM ONE PLASMODIUM SPECIES ELICIT ROBUST, BROADLY NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES AGAINST STRUCTURALLY RELATED ANTIGENS FROM ANOTHER SPECIES. THIS MECHANISM WAS DISCOVERED RECENTLY IN COLOMBIAN AND BRAZILIAN POPULATIONS WHERE VAR2CSA ANTIBODIES CAN BE ACQUIRED OUTSIDE OF PREGNANCY FOLLOWING INFECTION WITH P. VIVAX, AND THESE ANTIBODIES BLOCKED SEQUESTRATION OF IRBCS USING IN VITRO CORRELATES OF PLACENTAL MALARIA. THE CROSS-REACTIVE EPITOPE IN P. VIVAX WAS MAPPED TO SUBDOMAIN (SD1) IN PVDBP AND HUMAN SD1-PURIFIED ANTIBODIES BLOCKED PARASITE ADHESION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A VACCINE TO PROTECT PREGNANT WOMEN FROM FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL MALARIA THAT IS BASED ON THE CROSS- REACTIVE EPITOPE IN VIVAX SD1. THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH SYNTHESIS OF THREE COMPLEMENTARY SPECIFIC AIMS. EPITOPES REQUIRED TO ELICIT FUNCTIONAL, CROSS-REACTIVE ANTIBODIES WILL BE IDENTIFIED IN AIM 1 THROUGH CONFORMATIONALLY CONSTRICTED PEPTIDE MICROARRAYS SCREENED WITH MOUSE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES (MABS) AND HUMAN MABS TO SD1 ISOLATED FROM COLOMBIAN STUDY POPULATIONS. EPITOPES WILL BE SYNTHESIZED AS PEPTIDE- CONJUGATES OR WITHIN ENGINEERED RECOMBINANT DOMAINS, AND IMMUNOGENICITY WILL BE OPTIMIZED IN AIM 2 TO PRODUCE ANTIBODIES WITH FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY AGAINST PARASITES THAT EXPRESS DIVERSE ALLELES OF VAR2CSA. IN THE THIRD AIM, THE CRYPTIC EPITOPES IN VAR2CSA RECOGNIZED BY THESE ANTIBODIES WILL BE MAPPED TO IDENTIFY THE TARGETS OF ANTIBODIES ELICITED BY AN SD1-DERIVED VACCINE. THE INTEGRATION OF THESE FINDINGS WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT INSIGHT INTO THE MECHANISM OF CROSS-SPECIES EPITOPE RECOGNITION, WHICH WILL SERVE AS THE BASIS FOR A VIVAX VACCINE AGAINST FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL MALARIA AND COULD BE APPLIED MORE BROADLY TO VACCINES AGAINST OTHER MALARIA ANTIGENS.|EXPLOITING CROSS-REACTIVE, CONSERVED EPITOPES IN PLASMODIUM VIVAX TO DEVELOP A VACCINE AGAINST FALCIPARUM PLACENTAL MALARIA. - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A VACCINE IS URGENTLY NEEDED TO PROTECT PREGNANT WOMEN FROM MALARIA INFECTION AND THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF THIS DISEASE ON MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH.
